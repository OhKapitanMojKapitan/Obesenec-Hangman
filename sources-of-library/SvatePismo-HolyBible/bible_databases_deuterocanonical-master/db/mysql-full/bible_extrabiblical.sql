For I perceive that if I shall not hereafter add any more of my sins, I shall be saved. \n'),(11,4,'4',24,'24','And he said, Thou shalt be saved: and so shall all others, as many as shall observe these commandments. \n'),(11,4,'4',25,'25','And again I said unto him, Sir, seeing thou hearest me patiently, show me yet one thing more. Tell me, saith he, what it is. \n'),(11,4,'4',26,'26','And I said, If a husband or a wife die, and the party which survives marry again, does he sin in so doing? He that marries says he, sins not: howbeit, if he shall remain single, he shall thereby gain to himself great honour before the Lord. \n'),(11,4,'4',27,'27','Keep therefore thy chastity and modesty, and thou shalt live unto God.

There are two angels with man; one of righteousness, the other of iniquity. \n'),(11,6,'6',8,'8','And I said unto him, Sir, how shall I know that there are two such angels with man? Hear, says he, and understand. \n'),(11,6,'6',9,'9','The angel of righteousness, is mild and modest, and gentle, and quiet.

Hear, says he, and understand; When anger overtakes thee, or bitterness, know that he is in thee: \n'),(11,6,'6',13,'13','As also, when the desire of many things, and of the best meats, and of drunkenness; when the love of what belongs to others, pride, and much speaking, and ambition; and the like things, come upon thee. \n'),(11,6,'6',14,'14','When therefore these things arise in thine heart, know that the angel of iniquity is with thee. Seeing therefore thou knowest his works, depart from them all, and give no credit to him: because his works are evil, and become not the servants of God. \n'),(11,6,'6',15,'15','Here therefore thou hast the works of both these angels.

But doubting is an earthly spirit, and proceedeth from the Devil, and has no strength. \n'),(11,9,'9',11,'11','Do thou therefore keep the virtue of faith, and depart from doubting, in which is no virtue, and thou shalt live unto God. And all shall live unto God, as many as do these things.\n'),(11,10,'10',1,'1','Put all sadness far from thee; for it is the sister of doubting and of anger. How, sir, said I is it the sister of these? For sadness, and anger, and doubting, seem to me to be very different from one another. \n'),(11,10,'10',2,'2','And he answered: Art thou without sense that thou dost not understand it? For sadness is the most mischievous of all spirits, and the worst to the servants of God: It destroys the spirits of all men, and torments the Holy Spirit, and it saves again. \n'),(11,10,'10',3,'3','Sir, said I, I am very foolish, and understand not these things. I cannot apprehend how it can torment, and yet save. Hear, said he, and understand. They who never sought out the truth, nor inquired concerning the majesty of God, but only believed, are involved in the affairs of the heathen. \n'),(11,10,'10',4,'4','And there is another lying prophet that destroys the minds of the servants of God; that is of those that are doubtful, not of those that fully trust in the Lord. Now those doubtful persons come to him, as to a divine spirit, and inquire of him what shall befall them. \n'),(11,10,'10',5,'5','And this lying prophet, having no power in him of the Divine Spirit, answers them according to their demands, and fills their souls with promises according as they desire. Howbeit that prophet is vain, and answers vain things to those who are themselves vain. \n'),(11,10,'10',6,'6','And whatsoever is asked of him by vain men, he answers them vainly; nevertheless he speaketh some things truly.

He replied, I speak it, because it is not the true fast which you think that you keep; but I will show you what that is which is a complete fast, and acceptable unto God. \n'),(12,5,'5',4,'4','Hearken, said he, The Lord does not desire such a needless fast; for by fasting in this manner, thou advancest nothing in righteousness. \n'),(12,5,'5',5,'5','But the true fast is this: Do nothing wickedly in thy life, but serve God with a pure mind; and keep his commandments, and walk according to his precepts, nor suffer any wicked desire to enter into the mind. \n'),(12,5,'5',6,'6','But trust in the Lord, that if thou dost these things, any fearest him, and abstaineth from every evil work, thou shall live unto God. \n'),(12,5,'5',7,'7','If thou shalt do this, thou shall perfect a great fast, and an acceptable one unto the Lord. \n'),(12,5,'5',8,'8','Hearken unto the similitude which I am about to propose unto thee, as to this matter. \n'),(12,5,'5',9,'9','A certain man having a farm, and many servants, planted a vineyard in a certain part of his estate for his posterity: \n'),(12,5,'5',10,'10','And taking a journey into a far country, chose one of his servants which he thought the most faithful and approved, and delivered the vineyard into his care; commanding him that he should stake up the vines. Which if he did, and fulfilled his command, he promised to give him his liberty. Nor did he command him to do any thing more; and so went into a far country. \n'),(12,5,'5',11,'11','And after that servant had taken that charge upon him, he did whatsoever his lord commanded him. And when he had staked the vineyard, and found it to be full of weeds, he began to think within himself, saying: \n'),(12,5,'5',12,'12','I have done what my lord commanded me, I will now dig this vineyard, and when it is digged, it will be more beautiful; and the weeds being pulled up, it will bring forth more fruit and not be choked by the weeds. \n'),(12,5,'5',13,'13','So setting about this work he digged it, and plucked up all the weeds that were in it; and so the vineyard became very beautiful and prosperous, not being choked with weeds. \n'),(12,5,'5',14,'14','After some time the lord of the vineyard comes and goes into the vineyard, and when he saw that it was handsomely staked and digged, and the weeds plucked up that were in it, and the vines flourishing, he rejoiced greatly at the care of his servant. \n'),(12,5,'5',15,'15','And calling his son whom he loved, and who was to be his heir, and his friends with whom he was wont to consult; he tells them what he had commanded his servant to do, and what his servant had done more; and they immediately congratulated that servant, that he had received so full a testimony from his lord. \n'),(12,5,'5',16,'16','Then he said to them, I indeed promised this servant his liberty, if he observed the command which I gave him; and he observed it, and besides has done a good work to my vineyard, which has exceedingly pleased me. \n'),(12,5,'5',17,'17','Wherefore, for this work which he hath done, I will make him my heir together with my son; because that when he saw what was good, he neglected it not, but did it. \n'),(12,5,'5',18,'18','This design of the lord both his son and his friends approved, namely, that his servant should be heir together with his son. \n'),(12,5,'5',19,'19','Not long after this the master of the family calling together, his friends, sent from his supper several kinds of food to that servant. \n'),(12,5,'5',20,'20','Which when he had received, he took so much of them as was sufficient for himself, and divided the rest among his fellow-servants. \n'),(12,5,'5',21,'21','Which when they had received, they rejoiced; and wished that he might find yet greater favour with his lord, for what he had done to them. \n'),(12,5,'5',22,'22','When his lord heard all these things, he was again filled with great joy: and calling again his friends and his son together, he related to them what his servant had done with the meats which he had sent unto him. \n'),(12,5,'5',23,'23','They therefore so much the more assented to the master of the household; and he ought to make that servant his heir together with his son. \n'),(12,5,'5',24,'24','I said unto him, sir, I know not these similitudes, neither can I understand them, unless you expound them unto me. I will, says he, expound, all things unto thee whatsoever I have talked with thee, or shown unto thee. \n'),(12,5,'5',25,'25','Keep the commandments of the Lord and thou shalt be approved, and shall be written in the number of those that keep his commandments. But if besides those things which the Lord hath commanded, thou shalt add some good thing; thou shall purchase to thyself a greater dignity, and be in more favour with the Lord than thou shouldst otherwise have been. \n'),(12,5,'5',26,'26','If therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord, and shalt add to them these stations, thou shall rejoice; but especially if thou shalt keep them according to my commands. \n'),(12,5,'5',27,'27','I said unto him, sir, whatsoever thou shah command me, I will observe; for I know that thou wilt be with me. I will, said he, be with thee who hast taken up such a resolution; and I will be with all those who purpose in like manner. \n'),(12,5,'5',28,'28','This fast, saith he, whilst thou dost also observe the commandments of the Lord, is exceeding good; therefore thus shalt thou keep it. \n'),(12,5,'5',29,'29','First of all, take heed to thyself, and keep thyself from every wicked act, and from every filthy word, and from every hurtful desire; and purify thy mind from all the vanity of this present world. If thou shalt observe these things, this fast shall be right. \n'),(12,5,'5',30,'30','Thus therefore do. Having performed what is before written, that day on which thou fastest thou shalt taste nothing at all but bread and water; and computing the quantity of food which thou art want to eat upon other days, thou shalt lay aside the expense which thou shouldest have made that day, and give it unto the widow, the fatherless, and the poor. \n'),(12,5,'5',31,'31','And thus thou shalt perfect the humiliation of thy soul; that he who receives of it may satisfy his soul, and his prayer come up to the Lord God for thee. \n'),(12,5,'5',32,'32','If therefore thou shalt thus accomplish thy fast, as I command thee, thy sacrifice shall be acceptable unto the Lord, and thy fast shall be written in his book. \n'),(12,5,'5',33,'33','This station, thus performed, is good and pleasing and acceptable unto the Lord. These things if thou shalt observe with thy children and with all thy house, thou shalt be happy. \n'),(12,5,'5',34,'34','And whosoever, when they hear these things, shall do them, they also shall be happy; and whatsoever they shall ask of the Lord they shall receive it. \n'),(12,5,'5',35,'35','And I prayed him that he would expound unto me the similitude of the farm, and the Lord, and of the vineyard, and of the servant that had staked the vineyard; and of the weeds that were plucked out of the vineyard; and of his son and his friends which he took into counsel with him; for I understand that that was a similitude. \n'),(12,5,'5',36,'36','He said unto me, Thou art very bold in asking; for thou oughtest not to ask any thing; because if it be fitting to show it unto thee, it shall be showed unto thee. \n'),(12,5,'5',37,'37','I answered him; Sir, whatsoever thou shalt show me, without explaining it unto me, I shall in vain see it, if I do not understand what it is. And if thou shalt propose any similitudes, and not expound them, I shall in vain hear them. \n'),(12,5,'5',38,'38','He answered me again, saying: Whosoever is the servant of God, and has the Lord in his heart, he desires understanding of him, and receives it; and he explains every similitude, and understands the words of the Lord which need an inquiry. \n'),(12,5,'5',39,'39','But they that are lazy and slow to pray, doubt to seek from the Lord: although the Lord be of such an extraordinary goodness, that without ceasing he giveth all things to them that ask of him. \n'),(12,5,'5',40,'40','Thou therefore who art strengthened by that venerable messenger, and hast received such a powerful gift of prayer; seeing thou art not slothful, why dost thou not now ask understanding of the Lord, and receive it? \n'),(12,5,'5',41,'41','I said unto him; seeing I have thee present, it is necessary that I should seek it of thee, and ask thee; for thou shewest all things unto me, and speakest to me when thou art present. \n'),(12,5,'5',42,'42','But if I should see or hear these things when thou wert not present, I would then ask the Lord that he would chew them unto me. \n'),(12,5,'5',43,'43','And he replied, I said a little before that thou wert subtle and bold, in that thou asketh the meaning of these similitudes. \n'),(12,5,'5',44,'44','But because thou still persistest, I will unfold to thee this parable which then desirest, that thou mayest make it known unto all men. \n'),(12,5,'5',45,'45','Hear, therefore, said he, and understand. The farm before mentioned denotes the whole earth. The Lord of the farm is he, who created and finished all things; and gave virtue unto them. \n'),(12,5,'5',46,'46','His son is the Holy Spirit; the servant is the Son of God: the vineyard is the people whom he saves. The stakes are the messengers which are set oven them by the Lord, to support his people. The weeds that are plucked up out of the vineyard, are the sins which the servants of God had committed. \n'),(12,5,'5',47,'47','The food which he sent him from his supper, are the commands which he gave to his people by his Son. The friends whom he called to counsel with him, are the holy angels whom he first created. The absence of the master of the household, is the time that remains unto his coming. \n'),(12,5,'5',48,'48','I said unto him, Sir, all these things are very excellent, and wonderful, and good. But, continued I, could I or any other man besides, though never so wise, have understood these things? \n'),(12,5,'5',49,'49','Wherefore now, sir, tell me, what I ask. He replied, ask me what thou wilt. Why, said I, is the Son of God in this parable, put in the place of a servant. \n'),(12,5,'5',50,'50','Hearken, he said: the Son of God is not put in the condition of a servant, but in great power and authority. I said unto him, how, sir? I understand it not. \n'),(12,5,'5',51,'51','Because, said he, the Son set his messengers over those whom the Father delivered unto him, to keep every one of them; but he himself laboured very much, and suffered much, that he might blot out their offences. \n'),(12,5,'5',52,'52','For no vineyard can be digged without much labour and pains. Wherefore having blotted out the sins of his people, he showed to them the paths of life, giving them the law which he had received of the Father. \n'),(12,5,'5',53,'53','You see, said he, that he is the Lord of his people, having received all power from his Father. But why the lord did take his son into counsel, about dividing the inheritance, and the good angels, hear now. \n'),(12,5,'5',54,'54','That Holy Spirit, which was created first of all, he placed in the body in which God should dwell; namely, in a chosen body, as it seemed good to him. This body therefore into which the Holy Spirit was brought, served that Spirit, walking rightly and purely in modesty; nor ever defiled that Spirit. \n'),(12,5,'5',55,'55','Seeing therefore the body at all times obeyed the Holy Spirit, and laboured rightly and chastely with him, nor faltered at anytime; that body being wearied conversed indeed servilely, but being mightily approved to God with the Holy Spirit, was accepted by him. \n'),(12,5,'5',56,'56','For such a stout course pleased God, because he was not defiled in the earth, keeping the Holy Spirit. He called therefore to counsel his Son, and the good angels, that there might be some place of standing given to this body which had served the Holy Spirit without blame; lest it should seem to have lost the reward of its service. \n'),(12,5,'5',57,'57','For every pure body shall receive its reward; that is found without spot, in which the Holy Spirit has been appointed to dwell. And thus you have now the exposition of this parable also. \n'),(12,5,'5',58,'58','Sir, said I, I now understand your meaning, since I have heard this exposition. Hearken farther, said he: keep this thy body clean and pure, that the Spirit which shall dwell in it may bear witness unto it, and be judged to have been with thee. \n'),(12,5,'5',59,'59','Also take heed that it be not instilled into thy mind that this body perishes, and thou abuse it to any lust. For if thou shalt defile thy body, thou shalt also at the same time defile the Holy Spirit; and if thou shalt defile the Holy Spirit, thou shall not live. \n'),(12,5,'5',60,'60','And I said, What if through ignorance this should have been already committed, before a man heard these words; How can he attain into salvation, who has thus defiled his body? \n'),(12,5,'5',61,'61','He replied, As for men\'s former actions which through ignorance they have committed, God only can afford a remedy unto them; for all the power belongeth unto him. \n'),(12,5,'5',62,'62','But now guard thyself; and seeing God is almighty and merciful, he will grant a remedy to what thou hast formerly done amiss, if for the time, to come thou shalt not defile thy body and spirit: \n'),(12,5,'5',63,'63','For they are companions together, and the one cannot be defiled but the other will be so too. Keep there fore both of them pure, and thou shalt live unto God.\n'),(12,6,'6',1,'1','As I was sitting at home, and praising God for all the things which I had seen; and was thinking concerning the commands, that they were exceedingly good, and great, and honest, and pleasant, and such as were able to bring a man to salvation; I said thus within myself, I shall be happy if I walk according to these commands; and whosoever shall walk in them shall live unto God. \n'),(12,6,'6',2,'2','Whilst I was speaking on this wise within myself, I saw him whom I had before been wont to see, sitting by me; and he spake thus unto me: \n'),(12,6,'6',3,'3','What doubtest thou concerning my commands which I have delivered unto thee? They are good, doubt not, but trust in the Lord, and thou shalt walk in them; for I will give thee strength to fulfil them. \n'),(12,6,'6',4,'4','These commands are profitable to those who shall repent of the sins which they have formerly committed; if for the time to come they shall not continue in them. \n'),(12,6,'6',5,'5','Whosoever therefore ye be that repent, cast away from you the naughtiness of the present world; and put on all virtue, and righteousness, and so shall ye be able to keep these commands; and not sin from henceforth any more. \n'),(12,6,'6',6,'6','For if ye shall keep yourselves from sin for the time to come, ye shall cut off a great deal of your former sins. Walk in my commands, and ye shall live unto God: These things have I spoken unto you. \n'),(12,6,'6',7,'7','And when he, had said this, he added; let us go into the field, and I will show thee shepherds of sheep. I replied, sir, let us go. \n'),(12,6,'6',8,'8','And we came into a certain field, and there he showed me a young shepherd, finely arrayed, with his garments of a purple colour. And he fed large flocks; and his sheep were full of pleasure, and in much delight and cheerfulness; and they skipping, ran here and there. \n'),(12,6,'6',9,'9','And the shepherd took very great satisfaction in his flock; and the countenance of that shepherd was cheerful, running up and down among his flock. \n'),(12,6,'6',10,'10','Then the angel said unto me, Seest then this shepherd? I answered, sir, I see him. He said unto me, this is the messenger of delight and pleasure. He therefore corrupts the minds of the servants of God, and turns them from the truth, delighting them with many pleasures, and they perish. \n'),(12,6,'6',11,'11','For they forget the commands of the living God, and live in luxury and in vain pleasures, and are corrupted by the evil angel, some of them even unto death; and others to a falling away. \n'),(12,6,'6',12,'12','I replied; I understand not what you mean, by saying unto death, and to a falling away. Hear, says he; all those sheep which thou sawest exceeding joyful, are such as have for ever departed from God, and given selves up to the lusts of this present time. \n'),(12,6,'6',13,'13','To these therefore there is no return, by repentance, unto life; because, to their other sins they have added this, that they have blasphemed the name of the lord: These kind of men are ordained unto death. \n'),(12,6,'6',14,'14','But those sheep which thou sawest not leaping, but feeding in one place; are such as have indeed given themselves up to pleasure and delights; but have not spoken anything wickedly against the Lord. \n'),(12,6,'6',15,'15','These therefore are only fallen off from the truth, and so have yet hope laid up for them in repentance. For such a falling off hath some hope still left of a renewal; but they that are dead, are utterly gone for ever. \n'),(12,6,'6',16,'16','Again we went a little farther forward, and he showed me a great shepherd, who had as it were a rustic figure; clad with a white goat\'s skin, having his bag upon his shoulder, and in his hand a stick full of knots, and very hard, and a whip in his other hand; and his countenance was stern and sour, enough to affright a man; such was his look. \n'),(12,6,'6',17,'17','He took from that young shepherd such sheep as lived in pleasures, but did not skip up and down; and drove them into a certain steep craggy place fall of thorns and briars, insomuch that they could not get themselves free from them: \n'),(12,6,'6',18,'18','But being entangled in them, fed upon thorns and briars, and were grievously tormented with his whipping. For he still drove them on, and afforded them not any place, or time, to stand still. \n'),(12,6,'6',19,'19','When therefore I saw them so cruelly whipped and afflicted, I was grieved for them; because they were greatly tormented, nor had they any rest afforded them. \n'),(12,6,'6',20,'20','And I said unto the shepherd that was with me: Sir, who is this cruel and implacable shepherd, who is moved with no compassion towards these sheep? He answered, This shepherd is indeed one of the holy angels, but is appointed for the punishment of sinners. \n'),(12,6,'6',21,'21','To him therefore are delivered those who have erred from God, and served the lusts and pleasures of this world. For this cause he punishes them every one according to their deserts, with cruel and various kinds of pains. \n'),(12,6,'6',22,'22','Sir, said I, I would know what kind of pains they are which every one undergoes? Hearken, said he; The several pains and torments are those which men every day undergo in their present lives. For some suffer losses; others poverty; others divers sicknesses. Some are unsettled; others suffer injuries from those that are unworthy; others fall under many other trials and inconveniences. \n'),(12,6,'6',23,'23','For many with an unsettled design at many things, and it profiteth them not; and they say that they have not success in their undertakings. \n'),(12,6,'6',24,'24','They do not call to their mind what they have done amiss, and they complain of the Lord. When therefore they shall have undergone all kind of vexation and inconvenience; then they are delivered over to me for good instruction, and are confirmed in the Faith of the Lord, and serve the Lord all the rest of their days with a pure mind. \n'),(12,6,'6',25,'25','And when they begin to repent of their sins, then they call to mind their works which they have done amiss, and give honour to God, saying, that he is a just Judge, and they have deservedly suffered all things according to their deeds. \n'),(12,6,'6',26,'26','Then for what remains of their lives, they serve God with a pure mind; and have success in all their undertakings, and receive from the Lord whatever they desire. \n'),(12,6,'6',27,'27','And then they give thanks unto the Lord that they were delivered unto me; nor do they suffer any more cruelty. \n'),(12,6,'6',28,'28','I said unto him; Sir, I entreat you still to show me now one thing. What, said he, dost thou ask? I said unto him; Are they who depart from the fear of God, tormented for the same time that they enjoyed their false delight and pleasures? He answered me; they are tormented for the same time. \n'),(12,6,'6',29,'29','And I said unto him; They are then tormented but little; whereas they who enjoy their pleasures so as to forget God, ought to endure seven times as much punishment. \n'),(12,6,'6',30,'30','He answered me; Thou art foolish, neither understandest thou the efficacy of this punishment. I said unto him; Sir, if I understood it, I would not desire you to tell me. \n'),(12,6,'6',31,'31','Hearken, said he, and learn what the force of both is, both of the pleasure and of the punishment. An hour of pleasure is terminated within its own space: but one hour of punishment has the efficacy of thirty days, a Whosoever therefore enjoys his false pleasure for one day, and is one day, tormented; that one day of punishment is equivalent to a whole year\'s space. \n'),(12,6,'6',32,'32','Thus look how many days any one pursues his pleasures, so many years is he punished for it. You see therefore how that the time of worldly enjoyments is but short; but that of pain and torments, a great deal more. \n'),(12,6,'6',33,'33','I replied; Sir, forasmuch as I do not understand at all these times of pleasure and pain; I entreat you that you would explain yourself more clearly concerning them. He answered me, saying; Thy foolishness still sticks unto thee. 34. Shouldst thou not rather purify thy mind, and serve God? Take heed, lest when thy time is fulfilled, thou be found still unwise. Hear then, as thou desirest, that thou mayest the more easily understand. \n'),(12,6,'6',35,'35','He that gives himself up one day to his pleasures and delights, and does whatsoever his soul desires, is full of great folly, nor understands what he does, but the day following forgets what he did the day before. \n'),(12,6,'6',36,'36','For delight and worldly pleasure are not kept in memory, by reason of the folly that is rooted in them. But when pain and torment befall a man a day, he is in effect troubled the whole year after; because his punishment continues firm in his memory. \n'),(12,6,'6',37,'37','Wherefore he remembers it with sorrow the whole year; and then calls to mind his vain pleasure and delight, and perceives that for the sake of that he was punished. \n'),(12,6,'6',38,'38','Whosoever therefore have delivered themselves over to such pleasures, are thus punished; because that when they had life, they rendered themselves liable to death. \n'),(12,6,'6',39,'39','I said unto him; Sir, what pleasures are hurtful? He answered; That is pleasure to every man which he doth willingly. \n'),(12,6,'6',40,'40','For the angry man, gratifying his passion, perceives pleasure in it; and so the adulterer, and drunkard; the slanderer and liar; the covetous man and the defrauder; and whosoever commits anything like unto these, he followeth his evil disposition, because he receives a satisfaction in the doing of it. \n'),(12,6,'6',41,'41','All these pleasures and delights are hurtful to the servants of God. For these therefore they are tormented and suffer punishment. \n'),(12,6,'6',42,'42','There are also pleasures that bring salvation unto men. For many, when they do what is good, find pleasure in it, and are attracted by the delights of it. \n'),(12,6,'6',43,'43','Now this pleasure is profitable to the servants of God, and brings life to such men; but those hurtful pleasures, which were before mentioned, bring torments and punishment. \n'),(12,6,'6',44,'44','And whosoever shall continue in them, and shall not repent of what they have done, shall bring death upon themselves.\n'),(12,7,'7',1,'1','After a few days I saw the same person that before talked with me, in the same field, in which I had seen those shepherds, And he said unto me; What seekest thou? Sir, said I, I came to entreat you that You would command the shepherd, who is the minister of punishment, to depart out of my house, because he greatly afflicts me. \n'),(12,7,'7',3,'3','And he answered, It is necessary for thee to endure inconveniencies and vexations; for so that good angel hath commanded concerning thee, because he would try thee. \n'),(12,7,'7',4,'4','Sir, said I; What so great offence have I committed, that I should be delivered to this messenger? Hearken, said he: Thou art indeed guilty of many sins, yet not so many that thou shouldest be delivered to this messenger. \n'),(12,7,'7',5,'5','But thy house hath committed many sins and offences, and therefore that good messenger being grieved at their doings commanded that for some time thou shouldst suffer affliction; that they may both repent of what they have done, and may wash themselves from all the lusts of this present world. \n'),(12,7,'7',6,'6','When therefore they shall have repented, and be purified, then that messenger which is appointed over thy punishment, shall depart from thee. \n'),(12,7,'7',7,'7','I said unto him; Sir, if they have behaved themselves so as to anger that good angel, yet what have I done? He answered: They cannot otherwise be afflicted, unless thou, who art the head of the family, suffer. \n'),(12,7,'7',8,'8','For whatsoever thou shalt suffer, they must needs feel it but as long as thou shalt stand well established, they cannot experience any vexation. \n'),(12,7,'7',9,'9','I replied; But, sir, behold they also now repent with all their hearts. I know, says he, that they repent with all their hearts; but dost thou therefore think that their offences who repent, are immediately blotted out. \n'),(12,7,'7',10,'10','No, they are not presently; but he that repents must afflict his soul and show himself humble in all his affairs, and undergo many and divers vexations. \n'),(12,7,'7',11,'11','And when he shall have suffered all things that were appointed for him; then perhaps HE that made him, and formed all things besides, will be moved with compassion towards him, and afford him some remedy; and especially if HE shall perceive his heart who repents, to be free from every evil work. \n'),(12,7,'7',12,'12','But at present it is expedient for thee, and for thy house, to be grieved; and it is needful that thou shoudest endure much vexation, as the angel of the Lord who committed thee unto me, has commanded. \n'),(12,7,'7',13,'13','Rather give thanks unto the Lord, that knowing what was to come he thought thee worthy, to whom he should foretel that trouble was coming upon thee, who art able to bear it. \n'),(12,7,'7',14,'14','I said unto him; Sir, but be thou also with me, and I shall easily undergo any trouble. I will, said he, be with thee; and I will entreat the messenger who is set over thy punishment, that he would moderate his afflictions towards thee. \n'),(12,7,'7',15,'15','And moreover thou shalt suffer adversity but for a little time; and then thou shalt again be restored to thy former state; only continue on in the humility of thy mind. \n'),(12,7,'7',16,'16','Obey the Lord with a pure heart; thou, and thy house, and thy children; and. walk in the commands which I have delivered unto thee; and then thy repentance may be firm and pure. \n'),(12,7,'7',17,'17','And if thou shalt keep these things with thy house, thy inconveniencies shall depart from thee. \n'),(12,7,'7',18,'18','And all vexation shall in like manner depart from those, whosoever shall walk according to these commands.\n'),(12,8,'8',1,'1','Again he showed me a willow which covered the fields and the mountains, under whose shadow came all such as were called by the name of the Lord. \n'),(12,8,'8',2,'2','And by that willow stood an. angel of the Lord very excellent and lofty, and did cut down bows from the willow with a great hook; and reached out to the people that were under the shadow of the willow, little rods, as it were about a foot long. \n'),(12,8,'8',3,'3','And when all of them had taken them, he laid aside his hook, and the tree continued entire, as I had before seen it; at which I wondered, and mused within myself. \n'),(12,8,'8',4,'4','Then that shepherd said unto me; Forbear to wonder that the tree continues whole, not-with-standing so many boughs have been cut off from it: but stay a little, for now it shall be shown thee, what that angel means, who gave those rods to the people. \n'),(12,8,'8',5,'5','So he again demanded the rods of them; and in the same order that every one had received them, was he called to him, and restored his rod; which when he had received, he examined them. \n'),(12,8,'8',6,'6','From some he received them dry and rotten, and as it were touched with the moth; those he commanded to be separated from the rest, and placed by themselves.

In the rods of others there was but a little green, and the rest dry; and these were set aside by themselves. \n'),(12,8,'8',10,'10','Others came, and brought their rods green as they had received them, and the greatest part of the people brought their rods thus; and the messenger greatly rejoiced at these, and they also were put apart by themselves. \n'),(12,8,'8',11,'11','Others brought in their rods not only green, but full of branches; and these were set aside, being also received by the angel with great joy.

Having said this to the shepherd, he departed. \n'),(12,8,'8',16,'16','After he was gone, the shepherd said unto me; Let us take the rods from them, and plant them; if perchance they may grow green again. I said unto him; Sir, how can those dry rods ever grow green again? \n'),(12,8,'8',17,'17','He answered me; That tree, is a willow, and always loves to live. If therefore these rods shall be planted, and receive a little moisture, many of them will recover themselves. \n'),(12,8,'8',18,'18','Wherefore I will try, and will pour water upon them, and if any of them can live, I will rejoice with them; but if not, at least by this means I shall be found not to have neglected my part. \n'),(12,8,'8',19,'19','Then he commanded me to call them; and they all came unto him, every one in the rank in which he stood, and gave him their rods; which having received he planted every one of them in their several orders. \n'),(12,8,'8',20,'20','And after he had planted them all, he poured much water upon them, insomuch that they were covered with water, and did not appear above it.

And I hope now that these rods are thus watered, many of them receiving in the moisture, will recover: \n'),(12,8,'8',22,'22','I said unto him, Sir, tell me what this tree denotes? For I am greatly astonished, that after so many branches have been cut off, it seems still to be whole: nor does there any thing the less of it appear to remain, which greatly amazes me. \n'),(12,8,'8',23,'23','He answered, Hearken. This great tree which covers the plains and the mountains, and all the earth, is the law of God, published throughout the whole world. \n'),(12,8,'8',24,'24','Now this law is the Son of God, who is preached to all the ends of the earth. The people that stand under its shadow, are those which have heard his preaching, and believed. \n'),(12,8,'8',25,'25','The great and venerable angel which you saw, was Michael who had the power over his people, and governs them.

And they replied, that he would be there presently to examine the building. \n'),(12,9,'9',49,'49','After a very little while I saw a great multitude of men coming, and in the middle of them a man so tall, that he surpassed the tower in height. \n'),(12,9,'9',50,'50','About him were those six, who before commanded in the building, and all the rest of those who had built that tower, and many others of great dignity: and the virgins that kept the tower ran to meet him, and kissed him, and began to walk near unto him. \n'),(12,9,'9',51,'51','But he examined the building with so much care, that he handled every stone; and struck every one with a rod which he held in his hand: \n'),(12,9,'9',52,'52','Of which some being so struck turned black as soot; others were rough; some looked as if they had cracks in them; others seemed maimed; some neither black nor white; some looked sharp, and agreed not with the other stones, and others were full of spots. \n'),(12,9,'9',53,'53','These were the several kinds of those stones which were not found proper in the building; all which the Lord commanded to be taken out of the tower, and laid near it, and other stones to be brought and put in their places. \n'),(12,9,'9',54,'54','And they that built, asked him from which of the mountains he would have stones brought to put in the place of those that were laid aside. But he forbad them to bring any from the mountains, and commanded that they should take them out of a certain field that was near. \n'),(12,9,'9',55,'55','So they digged in the field, and found many bright square stones, and some also that were round. Howbeit, all that were found in that field were taken away, and carried through the gate by those virgins; and those of them that were square were fitted and put into the places of those that were pulled out. \n'),(12,9,'9',56,'56','But the round ones were not put into the building, because they were hard, and it would have required too much time to cut them but they were placed about the tower, as if they should hereafter be cut square, and put into the building; for they were very white. \n'),(12,9,'9',57,'57','When he who was chief in dignity, and lord of the whole tower saw this, he called to him the shepherd that was with me, and gave him the stones that were rejected and laid about the tower, and said unto him; cleanse these stones with all care, and fit them into the building of the tower, that they may agree with the rest; but those that will not suit with the rest, cast away afar off from the tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',58,'58','When he had thus commanded him, he departed, with all those that came with him to the tower but those virgins still stood about the tower to keep it. \n'),(12,9,'9',59,'59','And I said unto that shepherd; How can these stones, seeing they have been rejected, return into the building of this tower? He replied; I will cut off the greatest part from these stones, and will add them to the building, and they will agree with the rest. \n'),(12,9,'9',60,'60','And I said, Sir, how will they be able to fill the same place, when they shall be so much cut away? He answered; They that shall be found too little shall be put into the middle of the building, and the greater shall be placed without, and keep them in. \n'),(12,9,'9',61,'61','When he had said thus unto me, he added; Let us go, and after three days we will return, and I will put these stones, being cleansed, into the tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',62,'62','For all these that are about the tower must be cleansed, lest the master of the house chance to come upon the sudden, and find those which are about the tower unclean; and be so exasperated that these stones should never be put into the building of this tower, and I shall be looked upon to have been unmindful of my master\'s commands. \n'),(12,9,'9',63,'63','When therefore we came after three days to the tower, he said unto me; Let us examine all these stones, and let us see which of them may go into the building. I answered, Sir, let us see. \n'),(12,9,'9',64,'64','And first of all we began to consider those which had been black; for they were found just such as they were when they were pulled out of the tower: wherefore he commanded them to be removed from the tower and put by themselves. \n'),(12,9,'9',65,'65','Then he examined those which had been rough; and commanded many of those to be cut round, and to be fitted by the virgins into the building of the tower; so they took them, and fitted them into the middle of the building and he commanded the rest to be laid by with the black ones, for they also were become black. \n'),(12,9,'9',66,'66','Next he considered those which were full of cracks, and many of those also he ordered to be pared away, and so to be added to the rest of the building, by the came virgins. \n'),(12,9,'9',67,'67','These were placed without because they were found entire; but the residue through the multitude of their cracks could not be reformed, and therefore were cast away from the building of the tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',68,'68','Then he considered those that had been maimed; many of these had cracks, and were become black; others had large clefts; these he commanded to be placed with those that were rejected; \n'),(12,9,'9',69,'69','But the rest being cleansed and reformed, he commanded to be put into the building. These therefore those virgins took up, and fitted into the middle of the building, because they were but weak. \n'),(12,9,'9',70,'70','After these he examined those which were found half white and half black, and many of those which were now black; these also he ordered to be laid among those that were cast away. \n'),(12,9,'9',71,'71','The rest were found altogether white; those were taken up by the virgins, and fitted into the same tower: and they were put in the outside, because they were found entire; that so they might keep in those that were placed in the middle, for nothing was cut off from them. \n'),(12,9,'9',72,'72','Next he looked upon those which had been hard and sharp; but few of these were made use of, because they could not be cut, for they were found very hard: but the rest were formed, and fitted by the virgins into the middle of the building, because they were more weak. \n'),(12,9,'9',73,'73','Then he considered those which had spots; of these a few were found black, and they were carried to their fellows. The rest were white and entire; and they were fitted by the virgins into the building, and placed in the outside, by reason of their strength. \n'),(12,9,'9',74,'74','After this he came to consider those stones which were white and round: and he said unto me, What shall we do with these stones? I answered, Sir, I cannot tell. \n'),(12,9,'9',75,'75','He replied, Canst thou think of nothing then for these? I answered, Sir, I understand not this art; neither am I a stone-cutter, nor can I tell anything. \n'),(12,9,'9',76,'76','And he said, seest thou not that they are very round? Now to make them square, I must cut off a great deal from them; howbeit, it is necessary that some of these should go into the building of the tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',77,'77','I answered; If it be necessary, why do you perplex yourself, and not rather choose, if you have any choice among them, and fit them into the building. \n'),(12,9,'9',78,'78','Upon this he chose out the largest and brightest, and squared them; which, when he had done the virgins took them up, and fitted them into the building. \n'),(12,9,'9',79,'79','And the rest that remained were carried back into the same field from which they were taken; howbeit, they were not cast away; because, said he, there is yet a little wanting to this tower, which is to be built; and perhaps the Lord will have these stones fitted into this building, because they are exceeding white. \n'),(12,9,'9',80,'80','Then there were called twelve very stately women, clothed with a black garment, girded, and their shoulders free, and their hair loose. These seemed to me to be country women. \n'),(12,9,'9',81,'81','And the shepherd commanded them to take up those stones which were cast out of the building, and carry them back to the mountains out of which they were taken. \n'),(12,9,'9',82,'82','And they took them all up joyfully, and carried them back to their places from whence they had been taken. \n'),(12,9,'9',83,'83','When not one stone remained about the tower, he said unto me, Let us go about this tower, and see whether anything be wanting to it. \n'),(12,9,'9',84,'84','We began therefore to go round about it; and when he saw that it was handsomely built, he began to be very glad; for it was so beautifully framed, that any one that had seen it must have been in love with the building. \n'),(12,9,'9',85,'85','For it seemed to be all but one stone, nor did a joint any where appear; but it looked as if it had all been cut out of one rock. \n'),(12,9,'9',86,'86','And when I diligently considered what a tower it was, I was extremely pleased: and he said unto me, Bring hither some lime and little shells, that I may fill up the spaces of those stones that were taken out of the building, and put in again; for all things about the tower must be made even. \n'),(12,9,'9',87,'87','And I did as he commanded me, and brought them unto him and he said unto me, Be ready to help me, and this work will quickly be finished. \n'),(12,9,'9',88,'88','He therefore filled up the spaces of those stones, and commanded the place about the tower to be cleansed. \n'),(12,9,'9',89,'89','Then those virgins took besoms, and cleansed all the place around, and took away all the rubbish, and threw water on; which being done, the palace became delightful, and the tower beauteous. \n'),(12,9,'9',90,'90','Then he said unto me, All is now clean if the Lord should come to finish the tower, he will find nothing whereby to complain of us. \n'),(12,9,'9',91,'91','When he had said this he would have departed. But I laid hold on his bag, and began to entreat him for the Lord\'s sake, that he would explain to me all things that he had shown me. \n'),(12,9,'9',92,'92','He said unto me, I have at present a little business; but I will suddenly explain all things unto thee. Tarry here for me till I come. \n'),(12,9,'9',93,'93','I said unto him, Sir, what shall I do here alone? He answered, Thou art not alone, seeing all these virgins are with thee. \n'),(12,9,'9',94,'94','I said, Sir, deliver me then unto them. Then he called them and said unto them, I commend this man unto you until I shall come; \n'),(12,9,'9',95,'95','So I remained with those virgins: now they were cheerful and courteous unto me; especially the four, which seemed to be the chieftest among them. \n'),(12,9,'9',96,'96','Then those virgins said unto me, that shepherd will not return hither to-day. I said unto them, What then shall I do? They answered, Tarry for him till the evening, if perhaps he may come and speak with thee; but if not, yet thou shalt continue with us till he does come. \n'),(12,9,'9',97,'97','I said unto them, I will tarry for him till evening; but if he comes not by that time, I will go home, and return hither again the next morning. \n'),(12,9,'9',98,'98','They answered me, As thou art delivered unto us, thou mayest not depart from us. I said, Where shall I tarry? \n'),(12,9,'9',99,'99','They replied, Thou shalt sleep with us as a brother, not as a husband; for thou art our brother, and we are ready from henceforth to dwell with thee; for thou art very dear to as. \n'),(12,9,'9',100,'100','Howbeit I was ashamed to continue with them. But she that seemed to be the chieftest amongst them, embraced me, and began to kiss me. And the rest when they saw that I was kissed by her, began also to kiss me as a brother; and led me about the tower, and played with me. \n'),(12,9,'9',101,'101','Some of them also sung psalms, others made up the chorus with them. But I walked about the tower with them, rejoicing silently, and seeming to myself to be grown young again. \n'),(12,9,'9',102,'102','When the evening came on, I would forthwith have gone home, but they withheld me, and suffered me not to depart. Wherefore I continued with them that night near the same tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',103,'103','So they spread their linen garments upon the ground; and placed me in the middle, nor did they anything else, only they prayed. \n'),(12,9,'9',104,'104','I also prayed with them without ceasing, nor less than they. Who, when they saw me pray in that manner, rejoiced greatly: and I continued there with their till the next day. \n'),(12,9,'9',105,'105','And when we had worshipped God, then the shepherd came and said unto them: You have done no injury to this man? They answered, Ask him. I said unto him, Sir, I have received a great deal of satisfaction in that I have remained with them. \n'),(12,9,'9',106,'106','And he said unto me, How didst thou sup? I answered, Sir, I feasted the whole night upon the words of the Lord. They received thee well then, said he? I said, Sir, very well. \n'),(12,9,'9',107,'107','He answered, Wilt thou now learn what thou didst desire? I replied, Sir, I will: and first I pray thee that thou shouldest show me all things in the order that I asked them. \n'),(12,9,'9',108,'108','He answered, I will do all as thou wouldst have me, nor will I hide any thing from thee. \n'),(12,9,'9',109,'109','First of all, Sir, said I, tell me, what this rock and this gate denote? Hearken, said he; this rock, and this gate, are the Son of God. I replied, Sir, how can that be; seeing the rock is old, but the gate new? \n'),(12,9,'9',110,'110','Hear, said he, O foolish man! and understand. The Son of God is indeed more ancient than any creature; insomuch that he was in council with his Father at the creation oft all things. \n'),(12,9,'9',111,'111','But the gate is therefore new, because he appeared in the last days in the fullness of time; that they who shall attain unto salvation, may by it enter into the kingdom of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',112,'112','You have seen, said he, those stones which were carried through the gate, how they were placed in the building of the tower; but that those which were not carried through the gate, were sent away into their own places? \n'),(12,9,'9',113,'113','I answered, sir, I saw it. Thus, said he, no man shall enter into the kingdom of God, but he who shall take upon him the name of the Son of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',114,'114','For if you would enter into any city, and that city should he encompassed with a wall, and had only one gate, could you enter into that city except by that gate? \n'),(12,9,'9',115,'115','I answered, Sir, how could I do otherwise? As therefore, said he, there would be no other way of entering into that city but by its gate, so neither can any one enter into the kingdom of God, but only by the name of his Son, who is most dear unto him. \n'),(12,9,'9',116,'116','And he said unto me, Didst thou see the multitude of those that built that tower? Sir, said I, I saw it. He answered, All those are the angels, venerable in their dignity, \n'),(12,9,'9',117,'117','With those is the Lord encompassed as with a wall: but the gate is the Son of God, who is the only way of coming unto God. For no man shall go to God, but by his Son. \n'),(12,9,'9',118,'118','Thou sawest also, said he, the six men, and in the middle of them that venerable great man, who walked about the tower, and rejected the stones out of the tower? \n'),(12,9,'9',119,'119','Sir, said I, I saw them. He answered, that tall man was the Son of God; and those six were his angels of most eminent dignity, which stand about him on the right hand and on the left. \n'),(12,9,'9',120,'120','Of these excellent angels none comes in unto God without him. He added, Whosoever there, fore shall not take upon him his name, he shall nor enter into the kingdom of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',121,'121','Then I said, What is this tower? This, said he, is the church. And what, Sir, are these virgins? He said unto me, These are the holy spirits, for no man can enter into the kingdom of God, except these clothe him with their garment, \n'),(12,9,'9',122,'122','For it will avail thee nothing to take up the name of the Son of God, unless thou shalt also receive their garment from them. For these virgins are the powers of the Son of God. So shall a man in vain bear his name, unless he shall be also endued with his powers. \n'),(12,9,'9',123,'123','And he said unto me, sawest thou those stones that were cast away? They bore indeed the name, but put not on their garment. I said, Sir, what is their garment? Their very names, said he, are their garment. \n'),(12,9,'9',124,'124','Therefore whosoever beareth the name of the Son of God, ought to bear their names also; for the Son of God also himself beareth their names. \n'),(12,9,'9',125,'125','As for those stones, continued he, which being delivered by their hands, thou sawest remain in the building, they were clothed with their power; for which cause thou seest the whole tower of the same colour with the rock, and made as it were of one stone. \n'),(12,9,'9',126,'126','So also those who have believed in God by his Son, have put on his spirit. Behold there shall be one spirit, and one body, and one colour of their garments; and all they shall attain this, who shall bear the names of these virgins. \n'),(12,9,'9',127,'127','And I said, Sir, why then were those stones cast away which were rejected, seeing they also were carried through the gate, and delivered by the hands of these virgins into the building of this tower? \n'),(12,9,'9',128,'128','Seeing, said he thou takest care to inquire diligently into all things, hear also concerning those stones which were rejected. All these received the name of the Son of God, and with that the power of these virgins \n'),(12,9,'9',129,'129','Having therefore received these spirits, they were perfected, and brought into the number of the servants of God; and they began to be one body, and to have one garment, for they were endued with the same righteousness, which they alike exercised. \n'),(12,9,'9',130,'130','But after that they beheld those women which thou sawest clothed with a black garment, with their shoulders at liberty and their hair loose; they fixed their desires upon them, being tempted with their beauty; and were clothed with their power, and cast off the clothing of the virgins: \n'),(12,9,'9',131,'131','Therefore were they cast off from the house of God, and delivered to those women. But they that were not corrupted with their beauty, remained in the house of God. This, said he, is the signification of those stones which were rejected. \n'),(12,9,'9',132,'132','And I said, sir, what if any of these men shall repent, and cast away their desire of those women, and be converted, and return to these virgins, and put on again their virtue; shall they not enter into the house of God? \n'),(12,9,'9',133,'133','They shall enter, said he, if they shall lay aside all the works of those women, and shall resume the power of these virgins, and shall walk in their works. \n'),(12,9,'9',134,'134','And for this cause there is a stop in the building, that if they shall repent, they may be added to the building of this tower; but if they shall not repent, that others may be built in their places, and so they may be utterly cast away. \n'),(12,9,'9',135,'135','For all these things I gave thanks unto the Lord, that being moved with mercy towards all those upon whom his name is carried, he sent to us the angel of repentance to preside over us who have sinned against him; and that he has refreshed our spirits which were almost gone, and who had no hope of salvation, but are now refreshed to the renewal of life. \n'),(12,9,'9',136,'136','Then I said, Show me now sir, why this tower is not built upon the ground, but upon a rock, and upon the gate? He replied, Thou art foolish, and without understanding, therefore thou asketh this. \n'),(12,9,'9',137,'137','And I said, sir, I must needs ask all things of you because I understand nothing at all. For all your answers are great and excellent; and which a man can hardly understand. \n'),(12,9,'9',138,'138','Hear, said he: The name of the Son of God is great and without bounds, and the whole world is supported by it. If therefore, said I, every creature of God be sustained by his Son, why should he not support those also who have been invited by him, and who carry his name, and walk in his commandments? \n'),(12,9,'9',139,'139','Seest thou not, said he, that he doth support them, who with all their heart, bear his name? He therefore is their foundation, and gladly supports those who do not deny his name, but willingly bear it. \n'),(12,9,'9',140,'140','And I said: Sir, tell me the names of these virgins; and of those women that were clothed with the black garment. \n'),(12,9,'9',141,'141','Hear, said he, the names of those virgins which are the more powerful, and stand at the corners of the gate. These are their names: \n'),(12,9,'9',142,'142','The first is called Faith; the second Continence; the third Power; the fourth Patience; the rest which stand beneath these are, Simplicity, Innocence, Chastity, Cheerfulness, Truth, Understanding, Concord, Charity. \n'),(12,9,'9',143,'143','Whosoever therefore bear these names, and the name of the Son of God, shall enter into the kingdom of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',144,'144','Hear now, said he, the names of those women, which were clothed with the black garment. Of these, four are the principal: the first is Perfidiousness; the second, Incontinence; the third, Infidelity; the fourth, Pleasure. \n'),(12,9,'9',145,'145','And the rest which follow are called thus, Sadness, Malice, Lust, Anger, Lying, Foolishness, Pride, and Hatred. The servant of God, which carries these spirits, shall see indeed the kingdom of God, but he shall not enter into it. \n'),(12,9,'9',146,'146','But, sir, what are those stones which were taken out of the deep and fitted into the building? The ten, said he, which were placed at the foundation, are the first age; the following five-and-twenty, are the second, of righteous men. \n'),(12,9,'9',147,'147','The next thirty-five, are the prophets and ministers of the Lord. And the forty, are the Apostles and doctors of the preaching of the Son of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',148,'148','And I said, sir, why did the virgins put even those stones into the building after they were carried through the gate? And he said, Because these first carried those spirits, and they departed not one from the other, neither the men from the spirits, nor the spirits from the men: \n'),(12,9,'9',149,'149','But the spirits were joined to those men even to the day of their death; who if they had not had these spirits with them, they could not have been useful to the building of this tower. \n'),(12,9,'9',150,'150','And I said, sir, show me this farther. He answered, What dost then ask? Why did these stones come out of the deep, and were placed into the building of this tower, seeing that they long ago carried those holy spirits? \n'),(12,9,'9',151,'151','It was necessary, said he, for them to ascend by water, that they might be at rest. For they could not otherwise enter into the kingdom of God, but by laying aside the mortality of their former life. \n'),(12,9,'9',152,'152','They therefore being dead, were nevertheless sealed with the seal of the Son of God, and so entered into the kingdom of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',153,'153','For before a man receives the name of the Son of God, he is ordained unto death; but when he receives that seal, he is freed from death, and assigned unto life. \n'),(12,9,'9',154,'154','Now that seal is the water of baptism, into which men go down under the obligation unto death, but come up appointed unto life. \n'),(12,9,'9',155,'155','Wherefore to those also was this seal preached, and they made use of it, that they might enter into the kingdom of God. \n'),(12,9,'9',156,'156','And I said, Why then, sir, did these forty stones also ascend with them out of the deep, having already received that seal? \n'),(12,9,'9',157,'157','He answered, Because these Apostles and teachers, who preached the name of the Son of God, dying after they had received his faith and power, preached to them who were dead before: and they gave this seal to them. \n'),(12,9,'9',158,'158','They went down therefore into the water with them, and again came up. But these went down whilst they were alive, and came up again alive: whereas those who were before dead, went down dead, but came up alive; \n'),(12,9,'9',159,'159','Through these therefore they received life, and knew the Son of God: for which cause they came up with them, and were fit to come into the building of the tower; and were not cut, but put in entire; because they died in righteousness, and in great purity; only this seal was wanting to them. \n'),(12,9,'9',160,'160','Thus you have the explication of these things. \n'),(12,9,'9',161,'161','I answered: Sir, tell me now what concerns those mountains; why are they so different, some of one form, and some of another? \n'),(12,9,'9',162,'162','Hear, said he; These twelve mountains which thou seest, are twelve nations, which make up the whole world. Wherefore the Son of God is preached to them, by those whom he sent unto them. \n'),(12,9,'9',163,'163','But why, said I, are they different, and every one of a figure? He replied, Hearken.

power and counsel.\n'),(28,7,'7',46,'46','And all the earth was of one tongue and words of union, but Nimrod did not go in the ways of the Lord, and he was more wicked than all the men that were before him, from the days of the flood until those days.\n'),(28,7,'7',47,'47','And he made gods of wood and stone, and he bowed down to them, and he rebelled against the Lord, and taught all his subjects and the people of the earth his wicked ways; and Mardon his son was more wicked than his father.\n'),(28,7,'7',48,'48','And every one that heard of the acts of Mardon the son of Nimrod would say, concerning him, From the wicked goeth forth wickedness; therefore it became a proverb in the whole earth, saying, From the wicked goeth forth wickedness, and it was current in the words of men

lifted up their eyes toward heaven that night to look at the stars, and they saw, and behold one very large star came from the east and ran in the heavens, and he swallowed up the four stars from the four sides of the heavens.\n'),(28,8,'8',3,'3','And all the wise men of the king and his conjurors were astonished at the sight, and the sages understood this matter, and they knew its import.\n'),(28,8,'8',4,'4','And they said to each other, This only betokens the child that has been born to Terah this night, who will grow up and be fruitful, and multiply, and possess all the

prince of thy host, and we yesternight came to his house, and we ate and drank and rejoiced with him that night.\n'),(28,8,'8',10,'10','And when thy servants went out from the house of Terah, to go to our respective homes to abide there for the night, we lifted up our eyes to heaven, and we saw a great star coming from the east, and the same star ran with great speed, and swallowed up four great stars, from the four sides of the heavens.\n'),(28,8,'8',11,'11','And thy servants were astonished at the sight which we saw, and were greatly terrified, and we made our judgment upon the sight, and

the earth, and inherit all their lands, he and his seed forever.\n'),(28,8,'8',12,'12','And now our lord and king, behold we have truly acquainted thee with what we have seen concerning this child.\n'),(28,8,'8',13,'13','If it seemeth good to the king to give his father value for this child, we will slay him before he shall grow up and increase in the land, and his evil increase against us, that we and our children perish through his evil.\n'),(28,8,'8',14,'14','And the king heard their words and they seemed good in his sight, and he sent and called for Terah, and Terah came before

birth.\n'),(28,8,'8',16,'16','And now therefore give me the child, that we may slay him before his evil springs up against us, and I will give thee for his value, thy house full of silver and gold.\n'),(28,8,'8',17,'17','And Terah answered the king and said to him: My Lord and king, I have heard thy words, and thy servant shall do all that his king desireth.\n'),(28,8,'8',18,'18','But my lord and king, I will tell thee what happened to me yesternight, that I may see what advice the king will give his servant, and then I will answer the king upon what he has just spoken; and the king said, Speak.\n'),(28,8,'8',19,'19','And Terah said to the king, Ayon, son of Mored, came to me yesternight, saying,\n'),(28,8,'8',20,'20','Give unto me the great and beautiful horse that the king gave thee, and I will give thee silver and gold, and straw and provender for its value; and I said to him, Wait till I see the king concerning thy words, and behold whatever the king saith, that will I do.\n'),(28,8,'8',21,'21','And now my lord and king, behold I have made this thing known to thee, and the advice which my king will give unto his servant, that will I follow.\n'),(28,8,'8',22,'22','And the king heard the words of Terah, and his anger was kindled and he considered him in the light of a fool.\n'),(28,8,'8',23,'23','And the king answered Terah, and he said to him, Art thou so silly, ignorant, or deficient in understanding, to do this thing, to give thy beautiful horse for silver and gold or even for straw and provender?\n'),(28,8,'8',24,'24','Art thou so short of silver and gold, that thou shouldst do this thing, because thou canst not obtain straw and provender to feed thy horse? and what is silver and gold to thee, or straw and provender, that thou shouldst give away that fine horse which I gave thee, like which there is none to be had on the whole earth?\n'),(28,8,'8',25,'25','And the king left off speaking, and Terah answered the king, saying, Like unto this has the king spoken to his servant;\n'),(28,8,'8',26,'26','I beseech thee, my lord and king, what is this which thou didst say unto me, saying, Give thy son that we may slay him, and I will give thee silver and gold for his value; what shall I do with silver and gold after the death of my son? who shall inherit me? surely then at my death, the silver and gold will return to my king who gave it.\n'),(28,8,'8',27,'27','And when the king heard the words of Terah, and the parable which he brought concerning the king, it grieved him greatly and he was vexed at this thing, and his anger burned within him.\n'),(28,8,'8',28,'28','And Terah saw that the anger of the king was kindled against him, and he answered the king, saying, All that I have is in the king\'s power; whatever the king desireth to do to his servant, that let him do, yea, even my son, he is in the king\'s power, without value in exchange, he and his two brothers that are older than he.\n'),(28,8,'8',29,'29','And the king said to Terah, No, but I will purchase thy younger son for a price.\n'),(28,8,'8',30,'30','And Terah answered the king, saying, I beseech thee my lord and king to let thy servant speak a word before thee, and let the king hear the word of his servant, and Terah said, Let my king give me three days\' time till I consider this matter within myself, and consult with my family concerning the words of my king; and he pressed the king greatly to agree to this.\n'),(28,8,'8',31,'31','And the king hearkened to Terah, and he did so and he gave him three days\'

the third day that the king sent to Terah, saying, Send me thy son for a price as I spoke to thee; and shouldst thou not do this, I will send and slay all thou hast in thy house, so that thou shalt not even have a dog remaining.\n'),(28,8,'8',33,'33','And Terah hastened, (as the thing was urgent from the king), and he took a child from one of his servants, which his handmaid had born to him that day, and Terah brought the child to the king and received value for him.\n'),(28,8,'8',34,'34','And the Lord was with Terah in this matter, that Nimrod might not cause Abram\'s death, and the king took the child from Terah and with all his might dashed his head to the ground, for he thought it had been Abram; and this was concealed from him from that day, and it was forgotten by the king, as it was the will of Providence not to suffer Abram\'s death.\n'),(28,8,'8',35,'35','And Terah took Abram his son secretly, together with his mother and nurse, and he concealed them in a cave, and he brought them their provisions monthly.\n'),(28,8,'8',36,'36','And the Lord was with Abram in the cave and he grew up, and Abram was in the cave ten years, and the king and his princes, soothsayers and

time.\n'),(28,9,'9',6,'6','And Abram was in Noah\'s house thirty-nine years, and Abram knew the Lord from three years old, and he went in the ways of the Lord until the day of his death, as Noah and his son Shem had taught him; and all the sons of the earth in those days greatly transgressed against the Lord, and they rebelled against him and they served other gods, and they forgot the Lord who had created them in the earth; and the inhabitants of the earth made unto themselves, at that time, every man his god; gods of wood and stone which could neither speak, hear, nor deliver, and the sons of men served them and they became their gods.\n'),(28,9,'9',7,'7','And the king and all his servants, and Terah with all his household were then the first of those that served gods of wood and

thoughts, and he saw the city and the tower which they were building.\n'),(28,9,'9',27,'27','And when they were building they built themselves a great city and a very high and strong tower; and on account of its height the mortar and bricks did not reach the builders in their ascent to it, until those who went up had completed a full year, and after that, they reached to the builders and gave them the mortar and the bricks; thus was it done daily.\n'),(28,9,'9',28,'28','And behold these ascended and others descended the whole day; and if a brick should fall from their hands and get broken,

hearing this day that he was coming, I went this day to meet him, and do you treat me in this manner?\n'),(28,32,'32',37,'37','And they answered him, and said unto him, As the Lord liveth, were not

men.\n'),(28,32,'32',38,'38','And the third camp also passed from them, and he still continued his road with his men toward Jacob, when the fourth camp came toward him, and they also did unto him and his men as the others had done.\n'),(28,32,'32',39,'39','And when Esau beheld the evil which the four angels had done to him and to his men, he became greatly afraid of his brother Jacob, and he went to meet him in peace.\n'),(28,32,'32',40,'40','And Esau concealed his hatred against Jacob, because he was afraid of his life on account of his brother Jacob, and because he imagined that the four camps that he had lighted upon were Jacob\'s servants.\n'),(28,32,'32',41,'41','And Jacob tarried that night with his servants in their camps, and he resolved with his servants to give unto Esau a present from all that he had with him, and from all his property; and Jacob rose up in the morning, he and his men, and they chose from amongst the cattle a present for Esau.\n'),(28,32,'32',42,'42','And this is the amount of the present which Jacob chose from his flock to give unto his brother Esau: and he selected two hundred and forty head from the flocks, and he selected from the camels and asses thirty each, and of the herds he chose fifty kine.\n'),(28,32,'32',43,'43','And he put them all in ten droves, and he placed each sort by itself, and he delivered them into the hands of ten of his servants, each drove by itself.\n'),(28,32,'32',44,'44','And he commanded them, and said unto them, Keep yourselves at a distance from each other, and put a space between the droves, and when Esau and those who are with him shall meet you and ask you, saying, Whose are you, and whither do you go, and to whom belongeth all this before you, you shall say unto them, We are the servants of Jacob, and we come to meet Esau in peace, and behold Jacob cometh behind us.\n'),(28,32,'32',45,'45','And that which is before us is a present sent from Jacob to his brother Esau.\n'),(28,32,'32',46,'46','And if they shall say unto you, Why doth he delay behind you, from coming to meet his brother and to see his face, then you shall say unto them, Surely he cometh joyfully behind us to meet his brother, for he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth to him, and after this I will see his face, peradventure he will accept of me.\n'),(28,32,'32',47,'47','So the whole present passed on in the hands of his servants, and went before him on that day, and he lodged that night with his camps by the border of the brook of Jabuk, and he rose up in the midst of the night, and he took his wives and his maid servants, and all belonging to him, and he that night passed them over the ford Jabuk.\n'),(28,32,'32',48,'48','And when he passed all belonging to him over the brook, Jacob was left by himself, and a man met him, and he wrestled with him that night until the breaking of the day, and the hollow of Jacob\'s thigh was out of joint through wrestling with him.\n'),(28,32,'32',49,'49','And at the break of day the man left Jacob there, and he blessed him and went away, and Jacob passed the brook at the break of day, and he halted upon his thigh.\n'),(28,32,'32',50,'50','And the sun rose upon him when he had passed the brook, and he came up to the place of his cattle and children.\n'),(28,32,'32',51,'51','And they went on till midday, and whilst they were going the present was passing on before them.\n'),(28,32,'32',52,'52','And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold Esau was at a distance, coming along with many men, about four hundred, and Jacob was greatly afraid of his brother.\n'),(28,32,'32',53,'53','And Jacob hastened and divided his children unto his wives and his handmaids, and his daughter Dinah he put in a chest, and delivered her into the hands of his servants.\n'),(28,32,'32',54,'54','And he passed before his children and wives to meet his brother, and he bowed down to the ground, yea he bowed down seven times until he approached his brother, and God caused Jacob to find grace and favor in the sight of Esau and his men, for God had heard the prayer of Jacob.\n'),(28,32,'32',55,'55','And the fear of Jacob and his terror fell upon his brother Esau, for Esau was greatly afraid of Jacob for what the angels of God had done to Esau, and Esau\'s anger against Jacob was turned into kindness.\n'),(28,32,'32',56,'56','And when Esau saw Jacob running toward him, he also ran toward him and he embraced him, and he fell upon his neck, and they kissed and they wept.\n'),(28,32,'32',57,'57','And God put fear and kindness toward Jacob in the hearts of the men that came with Esau, and they also kissed Jacob and embraced him.\n'),(28,32,'32',58,'58','And also Eliphaz, the son of Esau, with his four brothers, sons of Esau, wept with Jacob, and they kissed him and embraced him, for the fear of Jacob had fallen upon them all.\n'),(28,32,'32',59,'59','And Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women with their offspring, the children of Jacob, walking behind Jacob and bowing along the road to Esau.\n'),(28,32,'32',60,'60','And Esau said unto Jacob, Who are these with thee, my brother? are they thy children or thy servants? and Jacob answered Esau and said, They are my children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.\n'),(28,32,'32',61,'61','And whilst Jacob was speaking to Esau and his men, Esau beheld the whole camp, and he said unto Jacob, Whence didst thou get the whole of the camp that I met yesternight? and Jacob said, To find favor in the sight of my lord, it is that which God graciously gave to thy servant.\n'),(28,32,'32',62,'62','And the present came before Esau, and Jacob pressed Esau, saying, Take I pray thee the present that I have brought to my lord, and Esau said, Wherefore is this my purpose? keep that which thou hast unto thyself.\n'),(28,32,'32',63,'63','And Jacob said, It is incumbent upon me to give all this, since I have seen thy face, that thou still livest in peace.\n'),(28,32,'32',64,'64','And Esau refused to take the present, and Jacob said unto him, I beseech thee my lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, for I have therefore seen thy face, as though I had seen a god-like face, because thou wast pleased with me.\n'),(28,32,'32',65,'65','And Esau took the present, and Jacob also gave unto Esau silver and gold and bdellium, for he pressed him so much that he took them.\n'),(28,32,'32',66,'66','And Esau divided the cattle that were in the camp, and he gave the half to the men who had come with him, for they had come on hire, and the other half he delivered unto the hands of his children.\n'),(28,32,'32',67,'67','And the silver and gold and bdellium he gave in the hands of Eliphaz his eldest son, and Esau said unto Jacob, Let us remain with thee, and we will go slowly along with thee until thou comest to my place with me, that we may dwell there together.\n'),(28,32,'32',68,'68','And Jacob answered his brother and said, I would do as my lord speaketh unto me, but my lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with their young who are with me, go but slowly, for if they went swiftly they would all die, for thou knowest their burdens and their fatigue.\n'),(28,32,'32',69,'69','Therefore let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will go on slowly for the sake of the children and the flock, until I come to my lord\'s place to Seir.\n'),(28,32,'32',70,'70','And Esau said unto Jacob, I will place with thee some of the people that are with me to take care of thee in the road, and to bear thy fatigue and burden, and he said, What needeth it my lord, if I may find grace in thy sight?\n'),(28,32,'32',71,'71','Behold I will come unto thee to Seir to dwell there together as thou hast spoken, go thou then with thy people for I will follow thee.\n'),(28,32,'32',72,'72','And Jacob said this to Esau in order to remove Esau and his men from him, so that Jacob might afterward go to his father\'s house to the land of Canaan.\n'),(28,32,'32',73,'73','And Esau hearkened to the voice of Jacob, and Esau returned with the four hundred men that were with him on their road to Seir, and Jacob and all belonging to him went that day as far as the extremity of the land of Canaan in its borders, and he remained there some time.\n'),(28,33,'33',1,'1','And in some time after Jacob went away from the borders of the land, and he came to the land of Shalem, that is the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, and he rested in front of the city.\n'),(28,33,'33',2,'2','And he bought a parcel of the field which was there, from the children of Hamor the people of the land, for five shekels.\n'),(28,33,'33',3,'3','And Jacob there built himself a house, and he pitched his tent there, and he made booths for his cattle, therefore he called the name of that place Succoth.\n'),(28,33,'33',4,'4','And Jacob remained in Succoth a year and six months.\n'),(28,33,'33',5,'5','At that time some of the women of the inhabitants of the land went to the city of Shechem to dance and rejoice with the daughters of the people of the city, and when they went forth then Rachel and Leah the wives of Jacob with their families also went to behold the rejoicing of the daughters of the city.\n'),(28,33,'33',6,'6','And Dinah the daughter of Jacob also went along with them and saw the daughters of the city, and they

Shechem the son of Hamor, the prince of the land was also standing there to see them.\n'),(28,33,'33',8,'8','And Shechem beheld Dinah the daughter of Jacob sitting with her mother before the daughters

with her and humbled her, and he loved her exceedingly and placed her in his house.\n'),(28,33,'33',12,'12','And they came and told the thing unto Jacob, and when Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, Jacob sent twelve of his servants to fetch Dinah from the house of Shechem, and they went and came to the house of Shechem to take away Dinah from there.\n'),(28,33,'33',13,'13','And when they came Shechem went out to them with his men and drove them from his house, and he would not suffer them to come before Dinah, but Shechem was sitting with Dinah kissing and embracing her before their eyes.\n'),(28,33,'33',14,'14','And the servants of Jacob came back and told him, saying, When we came, he and his men drove us away, and thus did Shechem do unto Dinah before our eyes.\n'),(28,33,'33',15,'15','And Jacob knew moreover that Shechem had defiled his daughter, but he said nothing, and his sons were feeding his cattle in the field, and Jacob remained silent till their return.\n'),(28,33,'33',16,'16','And before his sons came home Jacob sent two maidens from his servants\' daughters to take care of Dinah in the house of Shechem, and to remain with her, and Shechem sent three of his friends to his father Hamor the son of Chiddekem, the son of Pered, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.\n'),(28,33,'33',17,'17','And Hamor the son of Chiddekem the Hivite came to the house of Shechem his son, and he sat before him, and Hamor said unto his son, Shechem, Is there then no woman amongst the daughters of thy people that thou wilt take

is very extensive, so dwell ye and trade therein and get possessions in it, and do therein as you desire, and no one shall prevent you by saying a word to you.\n'),(28,33,'33',26,'26','And Hamor ceased speaking unto Jacob and his sons, and behold Shechem his son had come after him, and he sat before them.\n'),(28,33,'33',27,'27','And Shechem spoke before Jacob and his sons, saying, May I find favor in your sight that you will give me your daughter, and whatever you say unto me that will I do for her.\n'),(28,33,'33',28,'28','Ask me for abundance of dowry and gift, and I will give it, and

not wish to do this, we shall take our daughter from them and go away.\n'),(28,33,'33',38,'38','And if they consent to do this and will do it, then when they are sunk down with pain, we will attack them with our swords, as upon one who is quiet and peaceable, and we will slay every male person amongst them.\n'),(28,33,'33',39,'39','And Simeon\'s advice pleased them, and Simeon and Levi resolved to do unto them as it was proposed.\n'),(28,33,'33',40,'40','And on the next morning Shechem and Hamor his father came again unto Jacob and his sons, to speak concerning Dinah, and to hear what answer the sons of Jacob would give to their words.\n'),(28,33,'33',41,'41','And the sons of Jacob spoke deceitfully to them, saying, We told our father Isaac all your words, and your words pleased him.\n'),(28,33,'33',42,'42','But he spoke unto us, saying, Thus did Abraham his father command him from God the Lord of the whole earth, that any man who is not of his descendants that should wish to take one of his daughters, shall cause every male belonging to him to be circumcised, as we are circumcised, and then we may give him our daughter for a wife.\n'),(28,33,'33',43,'43','Now we have made known to you all our ways that our father spoke unto us, for we cannot do this of which you spoke unto us, to give our daughter to an uncircumcised man, for it is a disgrace to us.\n'),(28,33,'33',44,'44','But herein will we consent to you, to give you our daughter, and we will also take unto ourselves your daughters, and will dwell amongst you and be one people as you have spoken, if you will hearken to us, and consent to be like us, to circumcise every male belonging to you, as we are circumcised.\n'),(28,33,'33',45,'45','And if you will not hearken unto us, to have every male circumcised as we are circumcised, as we have commanded, then we will come to you, and take our daughter from you and go away.\n'),(28,33,'33',46,'46','And Shechem and his father Hamor heard the words of the sons of Jacob, and the thing pleased them exceedingly, and Shechem and his father Hamor hastened to do the wishes of the sons of Jacob, for Shechem was very fond of Dinah, and his soul was riveted to her.\n'),(28,33,'33',47,'47','And Shechem and his father Hamor hastened to the gate of the city, and they assembled all the men of their city and spoke unto them the words of the sons of Jacob, saying,\n'),(28,33,'33',48,'48','We came to these men, the sons of Jacob, and we spoke unto them concerning their daughter, and these men will consent to do according to our wishes, and behold our land is of great extent for them, and they will dwell in it, and trade in it, and we shall be one people; we will take their daughters, and our daughters we will give unto them for wives.\n'),(28,33,'33',49,'49','But only on this condition will these men consent to do this thing, that every male amongst us be circumcised as they are circumcised, as their God commanded them, and when we shall have done according to their instructions to be circumcised, then will they dwell amongst us, together with their cattle and possessions, and we shall be as one people with them.\n'),(28,33,'33',50,'50','And when all the men of the city heard the words of Shechem and his father Hamor, then all the men of their city were agreeable to this proposal, and they obeyed to be circumcised, for Shechem and his father Hamor were greatly esteemed by them, being the princes of the land.\n'),(28,33,'33',51,'51','And on the next day, Shechem and Hamor his father rose up early in the morning, and they assembled all the men of their city into the middle of the city, and they called for the sons of Jacob, who circumcised every male belonging to them on that day and the next.\n'),(28,33,'33',52,'52','And they circumcised Shechem and Hamor his father, and the five brothers of Shechem, and then every one rose up and went home, for this thing was from the Lord against the city of Shechem, and from the Lord was Simeon\'s counsel in this matter, in order that the Lord might deliver the city of Shechem into the hands of Jacob\'s two sons.\n'),(28,34,'34',1,'1','And the number of all the males that were circumcised, were six hundred and forty-five men, and two hundred and forty-six children.\n'),(28,34,'34',2,'2','But Chiddekem, son of Pered, the father of Hamor, and his six brothers, would not listen unto Shechem and his father Hamor, and they would not be circumcised, for the proposal of the sons of Jacob was loathsome in their sight, and their anger was greatly roused at this, that the people of the city had not hearkened to them.\n'),(28,34,'34',3,'3','And in the evening of the second day, they found eight small children who had not been circumcised, for their mothers had concealed them from Shechem and his father Hamor, and from the men of the city.\n'),(28,34,'34',4,'4','And Shechem and his father Hamor sent to have them brought before them to be circumcised, when Chiddekem and his six brothers sprang at them with their swords, and sought to slay them.\n'),(28,34,'34',5,'5','And they sought to slay also Shechem and his father Hamor and they sought to slay Dinah with them on account of this matter.\n'),(28,34,'34',6,'6','And they said unto them, What is this thing that you have done? are there no women amongst the daughters of your brethren the Canaanites, that you wish to take unto yourselves daughters of the Hebrews, whom ye knew not before, and will do this act which your fathers never commanded you?\n'),(28,34,'34',7,'7','Do you imagine that you will succeed through this act which you have done? and what will you answer in this affair to your brethren the Canaanites, who will come tomorrow and ask you concerning this thing?\n'),(28,34,'34',8,'8','And if your act shall not appear just and good in their sight, what will you do for your lives, and me for our lives, in your not having hearkened to our voices?\n'),(28,34,'34',9,'9','And if the inhabitants of the land and all your brethren the children of Ham, shall hear of your act, saying,\n'),(28,34,'34',10,'10','On account of a Hebrew woman did Shechem and Hamor his father, and all the inhabitants of their city, do that with which they had been unacquainted and which their ancestors never commanded them, where then will you fly or where conceal your shame, all your days before your brethren, the inhabitants of the land of Canaan?\n'),(28,34,'34',11,'11','Now therefore we cannot bear up against this thing which you have done, neither can we be burdened with this yoke upon us, which our ancestors did not command us.\n'),(28,34,'34',12,'12','Behold tomorrow we will go and assemble all our brethren, the Canaanitish brethren who dwell in the land, and we will all come and smite you and all those who trust in you, that there shall not be a remnant left from you or them.\n'),(28,34,'34',13,'13','And when Hamor and his son Shechem and all the people of the city heard the words of Chiddekem and his brothers, they were terribly afraid of their lives at their words, and they repented of what they had done.\n'),(28,34,'34',14,'14','And Shechem and his father Hamor answered their father Chiddekem and his brethren, and they said unto them, All the words which you spoke unto us are true.\n'),(28,34,'34',15,'15','Now do not say, nor imagine in your hearts that on account of the love of the Hebrews we did this thing that our ancestors did not command us.\n'),(28,34,'34',16,'16','But because we saw that it was not their intention and desire to accede to our wishes concerning their daughter as to our taking her, except on this condition, so we hearkened to their voices and did this act which you saw, in order to obtain our desire from them.\n'),(28,34,'34',17,'17','And when we shall have obtained our request from them, we will then return to them and do unto them that which you say unto us.\n'),(28,34,'34',18,'18','We beseech you then to wait and tarry until our flesh shall be healed and we again become strong, and we will then go together against them, and do unto them that which is in your hearts and in ours.\n'),(28,34,'34',19,'19','And Dinah the daughter of Jacob heard all these words which Chiddekem and his brothers had spoken, and what Hamor and his son Shechem and the people of their city had answered them.\n'),(28,34,'34',20,'20','And she hastened and sent one of her maidens, that her father had sent to take care of her in the house of Shechem, to Jacob her father and to her brethren, saying:\n'),(28,34,'34',21,'21','Thus did Chiddekem and his brothers advise concerning you, and thus did Hamor and Shechem and the people of the city answer them.\n'),(28,34,'34',22,'22','And when Jacob heard these words he was filled with wrath, and he was indignant at them, and his anger was kindled against them.\n'),(28,34,'34',23,'23','And Simeon and Levi swore and said, As the Lord liveth, the God of the whole earth, by this time tomorrow, there shall not be a remnant left in the whole city.\n'),(28,34,'34',24,'24','And twenty young men had concealed themselves who were not circumcised, and these young men fought against Simeon and Levi, and Simeon and Levi killed eighteen of them, and two fled from them and escaped to some lime pits that were in the city, and Simeon and Levi sought for them, but could not find them.\n'),(28,34,'34',25,'25','And Simeon and Levi continued to go about in the city, and they killed all the people of the city at the edge of the sword, and they left none remaining.\n'),(28,34,'34',26,'26','And there was a great consternation in the midst of the city, and the cry of the people of the city ascended to heaven, and all the women and children cried aloud.\n'),(28,34,'34',27,'27','And Simeon and Levi slew all the city; they left not a male remaining in the whole city.\n'),(28,34,'34',28,'28','And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son at the edge of the sword, and they brought away Dinah from the house of Shechem and they went from there.\n'),(28,34,'34',29,'29','And the sons of Jacob went and returned, and came upon the slain, and spoiled all their property which was in the city and the field.\n'),(28,34,'34',30,'30','And whilst they were taking the spoil, three hundred men stood up and threw dust at them and struck them with stones, when Simeon turned to them and he slew them all with the edge of the sword, and Simeon turned before Levi, and came into the city.\n'),(28,34,'34',31,'31','And they took away their sheep and their oxen and their cattle, and also the remainder of the women and little ones, and they led all these away, and they opened a gate and went out and came unto their father Jacob with vigor.\n'),(28,34,'34',32,'32','And when Jacob saw all that they had done to the city, and saw the spoil that they took from them, Jacob was very angry at them, and Jacob said unto them, What is this that you have done to me? behold I obtained rest amongst the Canaanitish inhabitants of the land, and none of them meddled with me.\n'),(28,34,'34',33,'33','And now you have done to make me obnoxious to the inhabitants of the land, amongst the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and I am but of a small number, and they will all assemble against me and slay me when they hear of your work with their brethren, and I and my household will be destroyed.\n'),(28,34,'34',34,'34','And Simeon and Levi and all their brothers with them answered their father Jacob and said unto him, Behold we live in the land, and shall Shechem do this to our sister? why art thou silent at all that Shechem has done? and shall he deal with our sister as with a harlot in the streets?\n'),(28,34,'34',35,'35','And the number of women whom Simeon and Levi took captives from the city of Shechem, whom they did not slay, was eighty-five who had not known man.\n'),(28,34,'34',36,'36','And amongst them was a young damsel of beautiful appearance and well favored, whose name was Bunah, and Simeon took her for a wife, and the number of the males which they took captives and did not slay, was forty-seven men, and the rest they slew.\n'),(28,34,'34',37,'37','And all the young men and women that Simeon and Levi had taken captives from the city of Shechem, were servants to the sons of Jacob and to their children after them, until the day of the sons of Jacob going forth from the land of Egypt.\n'),(28,34,'34',38,'38','And when Simeon and Levi had gone forth from the city, the two young men that were left, who had concealed themselves in the city, and did not die amongst the people of the city, rose up, and these young men went into the city and walked about in it, and found the city desolate without man, and only women weeping, and these young men cried out and said, Behold, this is the evil which the sons of Jacob the Hebrew did to this city in their having this day destroyed one of the Canaanitish cities, and were not afraid of their lives of all the land of Canaan.\n'),(28,34,'34',39,'39','And these men left the city and went to the city of Tapnach, and they came there and told the inhabitants of Tapnach all that had befallen them, and all that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem.\n'),(28,34,'34',40,'40','And the information reached Jashub king of Tapnach, and he sent men to the city of Shechem to see those young men, for the king did not believe them in this account, saying, How could two men lay waste such a large town as Shechem?\n'),(28,34,'34',41,'41','And the messengers of Jashub came back and told him, saying, We came unto the city, and it is destroyed, there is not a man there; only weeping women; neither is any flock or cattle there, for all that was in the city the sons of Jacob took away.\n'),(28,34,'34',42,'42','And Jashub wondered at this, saying, How could two men do this thing, to destroy so large a city, and not one man able to stand against them?\n'),(28,34,'34',43,'43','For the like has not been from the days of Nimrod, and not even from the remotest time, has the like taken place; and Jashub, king of Tapnach, said to his people, Be courageous and we will go and fight against these Hebrews, and do unto them as they did unto the city, and we will avenge the cause of the people of the city.\n'),(28,34,'34',44,'44','And Jashub, king of Tapnach, consulted with his counsellors about this matter, and his advisers said unto him, Alone thou wilt not prevail over the Hebrews, for they must be powerful to do this work to the whole city.\n'),(28,34,'34',45,'45','If two of them laid waste the whole city, and no one stood against them, surely if thou wilt go against them, they will all rise against us and destroy us likewise.\n'),(28,34,'34',46,'46','But if thou wilt send to all the kings that surround us, and let them come together, then we will go with them and fight against the sons of Jacob; then wilt thou prevail against them.\n'),(28,34,'34',47,'47','And Jashub heard the words of his counsellors, and their words pleased him and his people, and he did so; and Jashub king of Tapnach sent to all the kings of the Amorites that surrounded Shechem and Tapnach, saying,\n'),(28,34,'34',48,'48','Go up with me and assist me, and we will smite Jacob the Hebrew and all his sons, and destroy them from the earth, for thus did he do to the city of Shechem, and do you not know of it?\n'),(28,34,'34',49,'49','And all the kings of the Amorites heard the evil that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem, and they were greatly astonished at them.\n'),(28,34,'34',50,'50','And the seven kings of the Amorites assembled with all their armies, about ten thousand men with drawn swords, and they came to fight against the sons of Jacob; and Jacob heard that the kings of the Amorites had assembled to fight against his sons, and Jacob was greatly afraid, and it distressed him.\n'),(28,34,'34',51,'51','And Jacob exclaimed against Simeon and Levi, saying, What is this act that you did? why have you injured me, to bring against me all the children of Canaan to destroy me and my household? for I was at rest, even I and my household, and you have done this thing to me, and provoked the inhabitants of the land against me by your proceedings.\n'),(28,34,'34',52,'52','And Judah answered his father, saying, Was it for naught my brothers Simeon and Levi killed all the inhabitants of Shechem? Surely it was because Shechem had humbled our sister, and transgressed the command of our God to Noah and his children, for Shechem took our sister away by force, and committed adultery with her.\n'),(28,34,'34',53,'53','And Shechem did all this evil and not one of the inhabitants of his city interfered with him, to say, Why wilt thou do this? surely for this my brothers went and smote the city, and the Lord delivered it into their hands, because its inhabitants had transgressed the commands of our God. Is it then for naught that they have done all this?\n'),(28,34,'34',54,'54','And now why art thou afraid or distressed, and why art thou displeased at my brothers, and why is thine anger kindled against them?\n'),(28,34,'34',55,'55','Surely our God who delivered into their hand the city of Shechem and its people, he will also deliver into our hands all the Canaanitish kings who are coming against us, and we will do unto them as my brothers did unto Shechem.\n'),(28,34,'34',56,'56','Now be tranquil about them and cast away thy fears, but trust in the Lord our God, and pray unto him to assist us and deliver us, and deliver our enemies into our hands.\n'),(28,34,'34',57,'57','And Judah called to one of his father\'s servants, Go now and see where those kings, who are coming against us, are situated with their armies.\n'),(28,34,'34',58,'58','And the servant went and looked far off, and went up opposite Mount Sihon, and saw all the camps of the kings standing in the fields, and he returned to Judah and said, Behold the kings are situated in the field with all their camps, a people exceedingly numerous, like unto the sand upon the sea shore.\n'),(28,34,'34',59,'59','And Judah said unto Simeon and Levi, and unto all his brothers, Strengthen yourselves and be sons of valor, for the Lord our God is with us, do not fear them.\n'),(28,34,'34',60,'60','Stand forth each man, girt with his weapons of war, his bow and his sword, and we will go and fight against these uncircumcised men; the Lord is our God, He will save us.\n'),(28,34,'34',61,'61','And they rose up, and each girt on his weapons of war, great and small, eleven sons of Jacob, and all the servants of Jacob with them.\n'),(28,34,'34',62,'62','And all the servants of Isaac who were with Isaac in Hebron, all came to them equipped in all sorts of war instruments, and the sons of Jacob and their servants, being one hundred and twelve men, went towards these kings, and Jacob also went with them.\n'),(28,34,'34',63,'63','And the sons of Jacob sent unto their father Isaac the son of Abraham to Hebron, the same is Kireath-arba, saying,\n'),(28,34,'34',64,'64','Pray we beseech thee for us unto the Lord our God, to protect us from the hands of the Canaanites who are coming against us, and to deliver them into our hands.\n'),(28,34,'34',65,'65','And Isaac the son of Abraham prayed unto the Lord for his sons, and he said, O Lord God, thou didst promise my father, saying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and thou didst also promise me, and establish thou thy word, now that the kings of Canaan are coming together, to make war with my children because they committed no violence.\n'),(28,34,'34',66,'66','Now therefore, O Lord God, God of the whole earth, pervert, I pray thee, the counsel of these kings that they may not fight against my sons.\n'),(28,34,'34',67,'67','And impress the hearts of these kings and their people with the terror of my sons and bring down their pride, and that they may turn away from my sons.\n'),(28,34,'34',68,'68','And with thy strong hand and outstretched arm deliver my sons and their servants from them, for power and might are in thy hands to do all this.\n'),(28,34,'34',69,'69','And the sons of Jacob and their servants went toward these kings, and they trusted in the Lord their God, and whilst they were going, Jacob their father also prayed unto the Lord and said, O Lord God, powerful and exalted God, who has reigned from days of old, from thence till now and forever;\n'),(28,34,'34',70,'70','Thou art He who stirreth up wars and causeth them to cease, in thy hand are power and might to exalt and to bring down; O may my prayer be acceptable before thee that thou mayest turn to me with thy mercies, to impress the hearts of these kings and their people with the terror of my sons, and terrify them and their camps, and with thy great kindness deliver all those that trust in thee, for it is thou who canst bring people under us and reduce nations under our power.\n'),(28,35,'35',1,'1','And all the kings of the Amorites came and took their stand in the field to consult with their counsellors what was to be done with the sons of Jacob, for they were still afraid of them, saying, Behold, two of them slew the whole of the city of Shechem.\n'),(28,35,'35',2,'2','And the Lord heard the prayers of Isaac and Jacob, and he filled the hearts of all these kings\' advisers with great fear and terror that they unanimously exclaimed,\n'),(28,35,'35',3,'3','Are you silly this day, or is there no understanding in you, that you will fight with the Hebrews, and why will you take a delight in your own destruction this day?\n'),(28,35,'35',4,'4','Behold two of them came to the city of Shechem without fear or terror, and they killed all the inhabitants of the city, that no man stood up against them, and how will you be able to fight with them all?\n'),(28,35,'35',5,'5','Surely you know that their God is exceedingly fond of them, and has done mighty things for them, such as have not been done from days of old, and amongst all the gods of nations, there is none can do like unto his mighty deeds.\n'),(28,35,'35',6,'6','Surely he delivered their father Abraham, the Hebrew, from the hand of Nimrod, and from the hand of all his people who had many times sought to slay him.\n'),(28,35,'35',7,'7','He delivered him also from the fire in which king Nimrod had cast him, and his God delivered him from it.\n'),(28,35,'35',8,'8','And who else can do the like? surely it was Abraham who slew the five kings of Elam, when they had touched his brother\'s son who in those days dwelt in Sodom.\n'),(28,35,'35',9,'9','And took his servant that was faithful in his house and a few of his men, and they pursued the kings of Elam in one night and killed them, and restored to his brother\'s son all his property which they had taken from him.\n'),(28,35,'35',10,'10','And surely you know the God of these Hebrews is much delighted with them, and they are also delighted with him, for they know that he delivered them from all their enemies.\n'),(28,35,'35',11,'11','And behold through his love toward his God, Abraham took his only and precious son and intended to bring him up as a burnt offering to his God, and had it not been for God who prevented him from doing this, he would then have done it through his love to his God.\n'),(28,35,'35',12,'12','And God saw all his works, and swore unto him, and promised him that he would deliver his sons and all his seed from every trouble that would befall them, because he had done this thing, and through his love to his God stifled his compassion for his child.\n'),(28,35,'35',13,'13','And have you not heard what their God did to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to Abimelech king of Gerar, through taking Abraham\'s wife, who said of her, She is my sister, lest they might slay him on account of her, and think of taking her for a wife? and God did unto them and their people all that you heard of.\n'),(28,35,'35',14,'14','And behold, we ourselves saw with our eyes that Esau, the brother of Jacob, came to him with four hundred men, with the intention of slaying him, for he called to mind that he had taken away from him his father\'s blessing.\n'),(28,35,'35',15,'15','And he went to meet him when he came from Syria, to smite the mother with the children, and who delivered him from his hands but his God in whom he trusted? he delivered him from the hand of his brother and also from the hands of his enemies, and surely he again will protect them.\n'),(28,35,'35',16,'16','Who does not know that it was their God who inspired them with strength to do to the town of Shechem the evil which you heard of?\n'),(28,35,'35',17,'17','Could it then be with their own strength that two men could destroy such a large city as Shechem had it not been for their God in whom they trusted? he said and did unto them all this to slay the inhabitants of the city in their city.\n'),(28,35,'35',18,'18','And can you then prevail over them who have come forth together from your city to fight with the whole of them, even if a thousand times as many more should come to your assistance?\n'),(28,35,'35',19,'19','Surely you know and understand that you do not come to fight with them, but you come to war with their God who made choice of them, and you have therefore all come this day to be destroyed.\n'),(28,35,'35',20,'20','Now therefore refrain from this evil which you are endeavoring to bring upon yourselves, and it will be better for you not to go to battle with them, although they are but few in numbers, because their God is with them.\n'),(28,35,'35',21,'21','And when the kings of the Amorites heard all the words of their advisers, their hearts were filled with terror, and they were afraid of the sons of Jacob and would not fight against them.\n'),(28,35,'35',22,'22','And they

kings turned and refrained from the sons of Jacob, for they durst not approach them to make war with them, for they were greatly afraid of them, and their hearts melted within them from their fear of them.\n'),(28,35,'35',24,'24','For this proceeded from the Lord to them, for he heard the prayers of his servants Isaac and Jacob, for they trusted in him; and all these kings returned with their camps on that day, each to his own city, and they did not at that time fight with the sons of Jacob.\n'),(28,35,'35',25,'25','And the sons of Jacob kept their station that day till evening opposite mount Sihon, and seeing that these kings did not come to fight against them, the sons of Jacob returned home.\n'),(28,36,'36',1,'1','At that time the Lord appeared unto Jacob saying, Arise, go to Bethel and remain there, and make there an altar to the Lord who appeareth unto thee, who delivered thee and thy sons from affliction.\n'),(28,36,'36',2,'2','And Jacob rose up with his sons and all

that the shields of Simeon and Levi were broken, and he took two shields from his servants and brought them to Simeon and Levi.\n'),(28,38,'38',44,'44','And Simeon, Levi and Judah on that day fought all three against the eleven mighty men until the time of sunset, but they could not prevail over them.\n'),(28,38,'38',45,'45','And this was told unto Jacob, and he was sorely grieved, and he prayed unto the Lord, and he and Naphtali his son went against these mighty men.\n'),(28,38,'38',46,'46','And Jacob approached and drew his bow, and came nigh unto the mighty men, and slew three of their men with the bow, and the remaining eight turned back, and behold, the war waged against them in the front and rear, and they were greatly afraid of their lives, and could not stand before the sons of Jacob, and they fled from before them.\n'),(28,38,'38',47,'47','And in their flight they met Dan and Asher coming toward them, and they suddenly fell upon them, and fought with them, and slew two of them, and Judah and his brothers pursued them, and smote the remainder of them, and slew them.\n'),(28,38,'38',48,'48','And all the sons of Jacob returned and walked about the city, searching if they could find any men, and they found about twenty young men in a cave in the city, and Gad and Asher smote them all, and Dan and Naphtali lighted upon the rest of the men who had fled and escaped from the second tower, and they smote them all.\n'),(28,38,'38',49,'49','And the sons of Jacob smote all the inhabitants of the city of Sarton, but the women and little ones they left in the city and did

Goshen, and they took possession in it, and they were fruitful and multiplied in it.\n'),(28,56,'56',1,'1','And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven years.\n'),(28,56,'56',2,'2','At that time Jacob was attacked with that illness of which he died and he sent and called for his son Joseph from Egypt, and Joseph his son came from Egypt and Joseph came unto his father.\n'),(28,56,'56',3,'3','And Jacob said unto Joseph and unto his sons, Behold I die, and the God of your ancestors will visit you, and bring you back to the land, which the Lord sware to give unto you and unto your children after you, now therefore when I am dead, bury me in the cave which is in Machpelah in Hebron in the land of Canaan, near my ancestors.\n'),(28,56,'56',4,'4','And Jacob made his sons swear to bury him in Machpelah, in Hebron, and his sons swore unto him concerning this thing.\n'),(28,56,'56',5,'5','And he commanded them, saying, Serve the Lord your God, for he who delivered your fathers will also deliver you from all trouble.\n'),(28,56,'56',6,'6','And Jacob said, Call all your children unto me, and all the children of Jacob\'s sons came and sat before him, and Jacob blessed them, and he said unto them, The Lord God of your fathers shall grant you a thousand times as much and bless you, and may he give you the blessing of your father Abraham; and all the children of Jacob\'s sons went forth on that day after he had blessed them.\n'),(28,56,'56',7,'7','And on the next day Jacob again called for his sons, and they all assembled and came to him and sat before him, and Jacob on that day blessed his sons before his death, each man did he bless according to his blessing; behold it is written in the book of the law of the Lord appertaining to Israel.\n'),(28,56,'56',8,'8','And Jacob said unto Judah, I know my son that thou art a mighty man for thy brethren; reign over them, and thy sons

enemies.\n'),(28,56,'56',10,'10','And Jacob again commanded his sons on that day, saying, Behold I shall be this day gathered unto my people; carry me up from Egypt, and bury me in the cave of Machpelah as I have commanded you.\n'),(28,56,'56',11,'11','Howbeit take heed I pray you that none of your sons carry me, only yourselves, and this is the manner you shall do unto me, when you carry my body to go with it to the land of Canaan to bury me,\n'),(28,56,'56',12,'12','Judah, Issachar and Zebulun shall carry my bier at the eastern side; Reuben, Simeon and Gad at the south, Ephraim,

we do; may God only be with us.\n'),(28,56,'56',19,'19','And Jacob said unto his sons, So may God be with you when you keep all his ways; turn not from his ways either to the right or the left in performing what is good and upright in his sight.\n'),(28,56,'56',20,'20','For I know that many and grievous troubles will befall you in the latter days in the land, yea your children and children\'s

affliction, and bring you out of Egypt and bring you back to the land of your fathers to inherit it securely.\n'),(28,56,'56',22,'22','And Jacob ceased commanding his sons, and he drew his feet into the bed, he died and was gathered to his people.\n'),(28,56,'56',23,'23','And Joseph fell upon his father and he cried out and wept over him and he kissed him, and he called out in a bitter voice, and he said, O my father, my father.\n'),(28,56,'56',24,'24','And his son\'s wives and all his household came and fell upon Jacob, and they wept over him, and cried in a very loud voice concerning Jacob.\n'),(28,56,'56',25,'25','And all the sons of Jacob rose up together, and they tore their garments, and they all put sackcloth upon their loins, and they fell upon their faces, and they cast dust upon their heads toward the heavens.\n'),(28,56,'56',26,'26','And the thing was told unto Osnath Joseph\'s wife, and she rose up and put on a sack and she with all the Egyptian women with her

days.\n'),(28,56,'56',28,'28','And also from the land of Canaan did the women come unto Egypt when they heard that Jacob was dead, and they wept for him in Egypt for seventy days.\n'),(28,56,'56',29,'29','And it came to pass after this that Joseph commanded his servants the doctors to embalm his father with myrrh and frankincense and all manner of incense and perfume, and the doctors embalmed Jacob as Joseph had commanded them.\n'),(28,56,'56',30,'30','And all the people of Egypt and the elders and all the inhabitants of the land of Goshen wept and mourned over Jacob,

seventy days, Joseph said unto Pharaoh, I will go up and bury my father in the land of Canaan as he made me swear, and then I will return.\n'),(28,56,'56',32,'32','And Pharaoh sent Joseph, saying, Go up and bury thy father as he said, and as he made thee swear; and Joseph rose up with all his brethren to go to the land of Canaan to bury their father Jacob as he had commanded them.\n'),(28,56,'56',33,'33','And Pharaoh commanded that it should be proclaimed throughout Egypt, saying, Whoever goeth not up with Joseph and his brethren to the land of Canaan to bury Jacob, shall die.\n'),(28,56,'56',34,'34','And all Egypt heard of Pharaoh\'s proclamation, and they all rose up together, and all the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went up with Joseph, and all the officers and nobles of Pharaoh went up as the servants of Joseph, and they went to bury Jacob in the land of Canaan.\n'),(28,56,'56',35,'35','And the sons of Jacob carried the bier upon which he lay; according to all that their father commanded them, so did his sons unto him.\n'),(28,56,'56',36,'36','And the bier was of pure gold, and it was inlaid round about with onyx stones and bdellium; and the covering of the bier was gold woven work, joined with threads, and over them were hooks of onyx stones and bdellium.\n'),(28,56,'56',37,'37','And Joseph placed upon the head of his father Jacob a large golden crown, and he put a golden scepter in his hand, and they surrounded the bier as was the custom of kings during their lives.\n'),(28,56,'56',38,'38','And all the troops of Egypt went before him in this array, at first all the mighty men of Pharaoh, and the mighty men of Joseph, and after them the rest of the inhabitants of Egypt, and they were all girded with swords and equipped with coats of mail, and the trappings of war were upon them.\n'),(28,56,'56',39,'39','And all the weepers and mourners went at a distance opposite to the bier, going and weeping and lamenting, and the rest of the people went after the bier.\n'),(28,56,'56',40,'40','And Joseph and his household went together near the bier barefooted and weeping, and the rest of Joseph\'s servants went around him; each man had his ornaments upon him, and they were all armed with their weapons of war.\n'),(28,56,'56',41,'41','And fifty of Jacob\'s servants went in front of the bier, and they strewed along the road myrrh and aloes, and all manner of perfume, and all the sons of Jacob that carried the bier walked upon the perfumery, and the servants of Jacob went before them strewing the perfume along the road.\n'),(28,56,'56',42,'42','And Joseph went up with a heavy camp, and they did after this manner every day until they reached the land of Canaan, and they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which was on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned an exceeding great and heavy mourning in that place.\n'),(28,56,'56',43,'43','And all the kings of Canaan heard of this thing and they all went forth, each man from his house, thirty-one kings of Canaan, and they all came with their men to mourn and weep over Jacob.\n'),(28,56,'56',44,'44','And all these kings beheld Jacob\'s bier, and behold Joseph\'s crown was upon it, and they also put their crowns upon the bier, and encircled it with crowns.\n'),(28,56,'56',45,'45','And all these kings made in that place a great and heavy mourning with the sons of Jacob and Egypt over Jacob, for all the kings of Canaan knew the valor of Jacob and his sons.\n'),(28,56,'56',46,'46','And the report reached Esau, saying, Jacob died in Egypt, and his sons and all Egypt are conveying him to the land of Canaan to bury

came to mourn and weep over Jacob.\n'),(28,56,'56',48,'48','And it came to pass, when Esau came he mourned for his brother Jacob, and all Egypt and all Canaan again rose up and mourned a great mourning with Esau over Jacob in that place\n'),(28,56,'56',49,'49','And Joseph and his brethren brought their father Jacob from that place, and they went to Hebron to bury Jacob in the cave by his fathers.\n'),(28,56,'56',50,'50','And they came unto Kireath-arba, to the cave, and as they came Esau stood with his sons against Joseph and his brethren as a hindrance in the cave, saying, Jacob shall not be buried therein, for it belongeth to us and to our father.\n'),(28,56,'56',51,'51','And Joseph and his brethren heard the words of Esau\'s sons, and they were exceedingly wroth, and Joseph approached unto Esau, saying, What is this thing which they have spoken? surely my father Jacob bought it from thee for great riches after the death of Isaac, now five and twenty years ago, and also all the land of Canaan he bought from thee and from thy sons, and thy seed after thee.\n'),(28,56,'56',52,'52','And Jacob bought it for his sons and his seed after him for an inheritance for ever, and why speakest thou these things this day?\n'),(28,56,'56',53,'53','And Esau answered, saying, Thou speakest falsely and utterest lies, for I sold not anything belonging to me in all this land, as thou sayest, neither did my brother Jacob buy aught belonging to me in this land.\n'),(28,56,'56',54,'54','And Esau spoke these things in order to deceive Joseph with his words, for Esau knew that Joseph was not present in those days when Esau sold all belonging to him in the land of Canaan to Jacob.\n'),(28,56,'56',55,'55','And Joseph said unto Esau, Surely my father inserted these things with thee in the record of purchase, and testified the record with witnesses, and behold it is with us in Egypt.\n'),(28,56,'56',56,'56','And Esau answered, saying unto him, Bring the record, all that thou wilt find in the record, so will we do.\n'),(28,56,'56',57,'57','And Joseph called unto Naphtali his brother, and he said, Hasten quickly, stay not, and run I pray thee to Egypt and bring all the records;

thou shalt bring them unto us hither, that we may know from them all the words of Esau and his sons which they spoke this day.\n'),(28,56,'56',59,'59','And Naphtali hearkened to the voice of Joseph and he hastened and ran to go down to Egypt, and Naphtali was lighter on foot than any of the stags that were upon the wilderness, for he would go upon ears of corn without crushing them.\n'),(28,56,'56',60,'60','And when Esau saw that Naphtali had gone to fetch the records, he and his sons increased their resistance against the cave, and Esau and all his people rose up against Joseph and his brethren to battle.\n'),(28,56,'56',61,'61','And all the sons of Jacob and the people of Egypt fought with Esau and his men, and the sons of Esau and his people were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of Esau\'s people forty men.\n'),(28,56,'56',62,'62','And Chushim the son of Dan, the son of Jacob, was at that time with Jacob\'s sons, but he was about a hundred cubits distant from the place of battle, for he remained with the children of Jacob\'s sons by Jacob\'s bier to guard it.\n'),(28,56,'56',63,'63','And Chushim was dumb and deaf, still he understood the voice of consternation amongst men.\n'),(28,56,'56',64,'64','And he asked, saying, Why do you not bury the dead, and what is this great consternation? and they answered him the words of Esau and his sons; and he ran to Esau in the midst of the battle, and he slew Esau with a sword, and he cut off his head, and it sprang to a distance, and Esau fell amongst the people of the battle.\n'),(28,56,'56',65,'65','And when Chushim did this thing the sons of Jacob prevailed over the sons of Esau, and the sons of Jacob buried their father Jacob by force in the cave, and the sons of Esau beheld it.\n'),(28,56,'56',66,'66','And Jacob was buried in Hebron, in the cave of Machpelah which Abraham had bought from the sons of Heth for the possession of a burial place, and he was buried in very costly garments.\n'),(28,56,'56',67,'67','And no king had such honor paid him as Joseph paid unto his father at his death, for he buried him with great honor like unto the burial of kings.\n'),(28,56,'56',68,'68','And Joseph and his brethren made a mourning of seven days for their father.\n'),(28,57,'57',1,'1','And it was after this that the sons of Esau waged war with the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Esau fought with the sons of Jacob in Hebron, and Esau was still lying dead, and not buried.\n'),(28,57,'57',2,'2','And the battle was heavy between them, and the sons of Esau were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of the sons of Esau eighty men, and not one died of the people of the sons of Jacob; and the hand of Joseph prevailed over all the people of the sons of Esau, and he took Zepho, the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, and fifty of his men captive, and he bound them with chains of iron, and gave them into the hand of his servants to bring them to Egypt.\n'),(28,57,'57',3,'3','And it came to pass when the sons of Jacob had taken Zepho and his people captive, all those that remained were greatly afraid of their lives from the house of Esau, lest they should also be taken captive, and they all fled with Eliphaz the son of Esau and his people, with Esau\'s body, and they went on their road to Mount Seir.\n'),(28,57,'57',4,'4','And they came unto Mount Seir and they buried Esau in Seir, but they had not brought his head with them to Seir, for it was buried in that place where the battle had been in Hebron.\n'),(28,57,'57',5,'5','And it came to pass when the sons of Esau had fled from before the sons of Jacob, the sons of Jacob pursued them unto the borders of Seir, but they did not slay a single man from amongst them when they pursued them, for Esau\'s body which they carried with them excited their confusion, so they fled and the sons of Jacob turned back from them and came up to the place where their brethren were in Hebron, and they remained there on that day, and on the next day until they rested from the battle.\n'),(28,57,'57',6,'6','And it came to pass on the third day they assembled all the sons of Seir the Horite, and they assembled all the children of the east, a multitude of people like the sand of the sea, and they went and came down to Egypt to fight with Joseph

in order to deliver their brethren.\n'),(28,57,'57',8,'8','And Joseph and his brethren and the strong men of Egypt went forth and fought in the city of Rameses, and Joseph and his brethren dealt out a tremendous blow amongst the sons of Esau and the children of the east.\n'),(28,57,'57',9,'9','And they slew of them six hundred thousand men, and they slew amongst them all the mighty men of the children of Seir the Horite; there were only a few of them left, and they slew also a great many of the children of the east, and of the children of Esau; and Eliphaz the son of Esau, and the children of the east all fled before Joseph and his brethren.\n'),(28,57,'57',10,'10','And Joseph and his brethren pursued them until they came unto Succoth, and they yet slew of them in Succoth thirty men,

had smitten all their enemies.\n'),(28,57,'57',12,'12','And Zepho the son of Eliphaz and his men were still slaves in Egypt to the sons of Jacob, and their pains increased.\n'),(28,57,'57',13,'13','And when the sons of Esau and the sons of Seir returned to their land, the sons of Seir saw that they had all fallen into the hands of the sons of Jacob, and the people of Egypt, on account of the battle of the sons of Esau.\n'),(28,57,'57',14,'14','And the sons of Seir said unto the sons of Esau, You have seen andtherefore you know that this camp was on your account, and not one mighty man or an adept in war remaineth.\n'),(28,57,'57',15,'15','Now therefore go forth from our land, go from us to the land of Canaan to the land of the dwelling of your fathers; wherefore shall your children inherit the effects of our children in latter days?\n'),(28,57,'57',16,'16','And the children of Esau would not listen to the children of Seir, and the children

land.\n'),(28,57,'57',19,'19','And Angeas king of Dinhabah did so, for he was in those days friendly to the children of Esau, and Angeas sent five hundred valiant infantry to the children of Esau, and eight hundred cavalry.\n'),(28,57,'57',20,'20','And the children of Seir sent unto the children of the east and unto the children of Midian, saying, You have seen what the children of Esau have done unto us, upon whose account we are almost all destroyed, in their battle with the sons of Jacob.\n'),(28,57,'57',21,'21','Now therefore come unto us and assist us, and we will fight them together, and

children of the east listened to the children of Seir, and they came unto them about eight hundred men with drawn swords, and the children of Esau fought with the children of Seir at that time in the wilderness of Paran.\n'),(28,57,'57',23,'23','And the children of Seir prevailed then over the sons of Esau, and the children of Seir slew on that day of the children of Esau in that battle about two hundred men of the people of Angeas king of Dinhabah.\n'),(28,57,'57',24,'24','And on the second day the children of Esau came again to fight a second time with the children of Seir, and the battle

children of Esau in the second battle fifty-eight men of the people at Angeas king of Dinhabah.\n'),(28,57,'57',27,'27','And on the third day the children of Esau heard that some of their brethren had turned from them to fight against them in the second battle; and the children of Esau mourned when they heard this thing.\n'),(28,57,'57',28,'28','And they said, What shall we do unto our brethren who turned from us to assist the children of Seir our enemies? and the children of Esau again sent to Angeas king of Dinhabah, saying,\n'),(28,57,'57',29,'29','Send unto us again other men that with them we may fight with the children of Seir, for they have already twice been heavier than we were.\n'),(28,57,'57',30,'30','And Angeas again sent to the children of Esau about six hundred valiant men, and

Moab.\n'),(28,62,'62',9,'9','And Hadad fought with Moab, and there fell of the children of Moab and the children of Midian many slain ones, about two hundred thousand men.\n'),(28,62,'62',10,'10','And the battle was very severe upon Moab, and when the children of Moab saw that the battle was sore upon them, they weakened their hands and turned their backs, and left the children of Midian to carry on the battle.\n'),(28,62,'62',11,'11','And the children of Midian knew not the intentions of Moab, but they strengthened themselves in battle and fought with Hadad and all his host, and all Midian

children of Midian sent to all their brethren the children of the east, and all their brethren, all the children of Keturah came to assist Midian to fight with Moab.\n'),(28,62,'62',16,'16','And the children of Moab heard this thing, and they were greatly afraid that all the children of the east had assembled together against them for battle, and they the children of Moab sent a memorial to the

to war against us and wished to destroy us.\n'),(28,65,'65',18,'18','Now therefore the king commanded us to fortify the land, to build the cities Pithom and Rameses, and to fortify them for battle, if they should again come against us.\n'),(28,65,'65',19,'19','Whosoever of you from all Egypt and from the children of Israel will come to build with us, he shall have his daily wages given by the king, as his command is unto us.\n'),(28,65,'65',20,'20','And when Egypt and all the children of Israel heard all that the servants of Pharaoh had spoken, there came from the Egyptians, and the children of Israel to build with the servants of Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses, but none of the children of Levi came with their brethren to build.\n'),(28,65,'65',21,'21','And all the servants of Pharaoh and his princes came at first with deceit to build with all Israel as daily hired laborers, and they gave to Israel their daily hire at the beginning.\n'),(28,65,'65',22,'22','And the servants of Pharaoh built with all Israel, and were employed in that work with Israel for a month.\n'),(28,65,'65',23,'23','And at the end of the month, all the servants of Pharaoh began to withdraw secretly from the people of Israel daily.\n'),(28,65,'65',24,'24','And Israel went on with the work at that time, but they then received their daily hire, because some of the men of Egypt were yet carrying on the work with Israel at that time; therefore the Egyptians gave Israel their hire in those days, in order that they, the Egyptians their fellow-workmen, might also take the pay for their labor.\n'),(28,65,'65',25,'25','And at the end of a year and four months all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel, so that the children of Israel were left alone engaged in the work.\n'),(28,65,'65',26,'26','And after all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel they returned and became oppressors and officers over them, and some of them stood over the children of Israel as task masters, to receive from them all that they gave them for the pay of their labor.\n'),(28,65,'65',27,'27','And the Egyptians did in this manner to the children of Israel day by day, in order to afflict in their work.\n'),(28,65,'65',28,'28','And all the children of Israel were alone engaged in the labor, and the Egyptians refrained from giving any pay to the children of Israel from that time forward.\n'),(28,65,'65',29,'29','And when some of the men of Israel refused to work on account of the wages not being given to them, then the exactors and the servants of Pharaoh oppressed them and smote them with heavy blows, and made them return by force, to labor with their brethren; thus did all the Egyptians unto the children of Israel all the days.\n'),(28,65,'65',30,'30','And all the children of Israel were greatly afraid of the Egyptians in this matter, and all the children of Israel returned and worked alone without pay.\n'),(28,65,'65',31,'31','And the children of Israel built Pithom and Rameses, and all the children of Israel did the work, some making bricks, and some building, and the children of Israel built and fortified all the land of Egypt and its walls, and the children of Israel were engaged in work for many years, until the time came when the Lord remembered them and brought them out of Egypt.\n'),(28,65,'65',32,'32','But the children of Levi were not employed in the work with their brethren of Israel, from the beginning unto the day of their going forth from Egypt.\n'),(28,65,'65',33,'33','For all the children of Levi knew that the Egyptians had spoken all these words with deceit to the Israelites, therefore the children of Levi refrained from approaching to the work with their brethren.\n'),(28,65,'65',34,'34','And the Egyptians did not direct their attention to make the children of Levi work afterward, since they had not been with their brethren at the beginning, therefore the Egyptians left them alone.\n'),(28,65,'65',35,'35','And the hands of the men of Egypt were directed with continued severity against the children of Israel in that work, and the Egyptians made the children of Israel work with rigor.\n'),(28,65,'65',36,'36','And the Egyptians embittered the lives of the children of Israel with hard work, in mortar and bricks, and also in all manner of work in the field.\n'),(28,65,'65',37,'37','And the children of Israel called Melol the king of Egypt \"Meror, king of Egypt,\" because in his days the Egyptians had embittered their lives with all manner of work.\n'),(28,65,'65',38,'38','And all the work wherein the Egyptians made the children of Israel labor, they exacted with rigor, in order to afflict the children of Israel, but the more they afflicted them, the more they increased and grew, and the Egyptians were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n'),(28,66,'66',1,'1','At that time died Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, and Samlah from Mesrekah, from the country of the children of the east, reigned in his place.\n'),(28,66,'66',2,'2','In the thirteenth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, which was the hundred and twenty-fifth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, Samlah had reigned over Edom eighteen years.\n'),(28,66,'66',3,'3','And when he reigned, he drew forth his hosts to go and fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz and the children of Chittim, because they had made war against Angeas king of Africa, and they destroyed his whole army.\n'),(28,66,'66',4,'4','But he did not engage with him, for the children of Esau prevented him, saying, He was their brother, so Samlah listened to the voice of the children of Esau, and turned back with all his forces to the land of Edom, and did not proceed to fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz.\n'),(28,66,'66',5,'5','And Pharaoh king of Egypt heard this thing, saying, Samlah king of Edom has resolved to fight the children of Chittim, and afterward he will come to fight against Egypt.\n'),(28,66,'66',6,'6','And when the Egyptians heard this matter, they increased the labor upon the children of Israel, lest the Israelites should do unto them as they did unto them in their war with the children of Esau in the days of Hadad.\n'),(28,66,'66',7,'7','So the Egyptians said unto the children of Israel, Hasten and do your work, and finish your task, and strengthen the land, lest the children of Esau your brethren should come to fight against us, for on your account will they come against us.\n'),(28,66,'66',8,'8','And the children of Israel did the work of the men of Egypt day by day, and the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel in order to lessen them in the land.\n'),(28,66,'66',9,'9','But as the Egyptians increased the labor upon the children of Israel, so did the children of Israel increase and multiply, and all Egypt was filled with the children of Israel.\n'),(28,66,'66',10,'10','And in the hundred and twenty-fifth year of Israel\'s going down into Egypt, all the Egyptians saw that their counsel did not succeed against Israel, but that they increased and grew, and the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen were filled with the children of Israel.\n'),(28,66,'66',11,'11','So all the elders of Egypt and its wise men came before the king and bowed down to him and sat before him.\n'),(28,66,'66',12,'12','And all the elders of Egypt and the wise men thereof said unto the king, May the king live forever; thou didst counsel us the counsel against the children of Israel, and we did unto them according to the word of the king.\n'),(28,66,'66',13,'13','But in proportion to the increase of the labor so do they increase and grow in the land, and behold the whole country is filled with them.\n'),(28,66,'66',14,'14','Now therefore our lord and king, the eyes of all Egypt are upon thee to give them advice with thy wisdom, by which they may prevail over Israel to destroy them, or to diminish them from the land; and the king answered them saying, Give you counsel in this matter that we may know what to do unto them.\n'),(28,66,'66',15,'15','And an officer, one of the king\'s counsellors, whose name was Job, from Mesopotamia, in the land of Uz, answered the king, saying,\n'),(28,66,'66',16,'16','If it please the king, let him hear the counsel of his servant; and the king said unto him, Speak.\n'),(28,66,'66',17,'17','And Job spoke before the king, the princes, and before all the elders of Egypt, saying,\n'),(28,66,'66',18,'18','Behold the counsel of the king which he advised formerly respecting the labor of the children of Israel is very good, and you must not remove from them that labor forever.\n'),(28,66,'66',19,'19','But this is the advice counselled by which you may lessen them, if it seems good to the king to afflict them.\n'),(28,66,'66',20,'20','Behold we have feared war for a long time, and we said, When Israel becomes fruitful in the land, they will drive us from the land if a war should take place.\n'),(28,66,'66',21,'21','If it please the king, let a royal decree go forth, and let it be written in the laws of Egypt which shall not be revoked, that every male child born to the Israelites, his blood shall be spilled upon the ground.\n'),(28,66,'66',22,'22','And by your doing this, when all the male children of Israel shall have died, the evil of their wars will cease; let the king do so and send for all the Hebrew midwives and order them in this matter to execute it; so the thing pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Job.\n'),(28,66,'66',23,'23','And the king sent for the Hebrew midwives to be called, of which the name of one was Shephrah, and the name of the other Puah.\n'),(28,66,'66',24,'24','And the midwives came before the king, and stood in his presence.\n'),(28,66,'66',25,'25','And the king said unto them, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then you shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.\n'),(28,66,'66',26,'26','But if you will not do this thing, then will I burn you up and all your houses with fire.\n'),(28,66,'66',27,'27','But the midwives feared God and did not hearken to the king of Egypt nor to his words, and when the Hebrew women brought forth to the midwife son or daughter, then did the midwife do all that was necessary to the child and let it live; thus did the midwives all the days.\n'),(28,66,'66',28,'28','And this thing was told to the king, and he sent and called for the midwives and he said to them, Why have you done this thing and have saved the children alive?\n'),(28,66,'66',29,'29','And the midwives answered and spoke together before the king, saying,\n'),(28,66,'66',30,'30','Let not the king think that the Hebrew women are as the Egyptian women, for all the children of Israel are hale, and before the midwife comes to them they are delivered, and as for us thy handmaids, for many days no Hebrew woman has brought forth upon us, for all the Hebrew women are their own midwives, because they are hale.\n'),(28,66,'66',31,'31','And Pharaoh heard their words and believed them in this matter, and the midwives went away from the king, and God dealt well with them, and the people multiplied and waxed exceedingly.\n'),(28,67,'67',1,'1','There was a man in the land of Egypt of the seed of Levi, whose name was Amram, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.\n'),(28,67,'67',2,'2','And this man went and took a wife, namely Jochebed the daughter of Levi his father\'s sister, and she was one hundred and twenty-six years old, and he came unto her.\n'),(28,67,'67',3,'3','And the woman conceived and bare a daughter, and she called her name Miriam, because in those days the Egyptians had embittered the lives of the children of Israel.\n'),(28,67,'67',4,'4','And she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name Aaron, for in the days of her conception, Pharaoh began to spill the blood of the male children of Israel.\n'),(28,67,'67',5,'5','In those days died Zepho the son of Eliphaz, son of Esau, king of Chittim, and Janeas reigned in his stead.\n'),(28,67,'67',6,'6','And the time that Zepho reigned over the children of Chittim was fifty years, and he died and was buried in the city of Nabna in the land of Chittim.\n'),(28,67,'67',7,'7','And Janeas, one of the mighty men of the children of Chittim, reigned after him and he reigned fifty years.\n'),(28,67,'67',8,'8','And it was after the death of the king of Chittim that Balaam the son of Beor fled from the land of Chittim, and he went and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n'),(28,67,'67',9,'9','And Pharaoh received him with great honor, for he had heard of his wisdom, and he gave him presents and made him for a counsellor, and aggrandized him.\n'),(28,67,'67',10,'10','And Balaam dwelt in Egypt, in honor with all the nobles of the king, and the nobles exalted him, because they all coveted to learn his wisdom.\n'),(28,67,'67',11,'11','And in the hundred and thirtieth year of Israel\'s going down to Egypt, Pharaoh dreamed that he was sitting upon his kingly throne, and lifted up his eyes and saw an old man standing before him, and there were scales in the hands of the old man, such scales as are used by merchants.\n'),(28,67,'67',12,'12','And the old man took the scales and hung them before Pharaoh.\n'),(28,67,'67',13,'13','And the old man took all the elders of Egypt and all its nobles and great men, and he tied them together and put them in one scale.\n'),(28,67,'67',14,'14','And he took a milk kid and put it into the other scale, and the kid preponderated over all.\n'),(28,67,'67',15,'15','And Pharaoh was astonished at this dreadful vision, why the kid should preponderate over all, and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.\n'),(28,67,'67',16,'16','And Pharaoh rose up early in the morning and called all his servants and related to them the dream, and the men were greatly afraid.\n'),(28,67,'67',17,'17','And the king said to all his wise men, Interpret I pray you the dream which I dreamed, that I may know it.\n'),(28,67,'67',18,'18','And Balaam the son of Beor answered the king and said unto him, This means nothing else but a great evil that will spring up against Egypt in the latter days.\n'),(28,67,'67',19,'19','For a son will be born to Israel who will destroy all Egypt and its inhabitants, and bring forth the Israelites from Egypt with a mighty hand.\n'),(28,67,'67',20,'20','Now therefore, O king, take counsel upon this matter, that you may destroy the hope of the children of Israel and their expectation, before this evil arise against Egypt.\n'),(28,67,'67',21,'21','And the king said unto Balaam, And what shall we do unto Israel? surely after a certain manner did we at first counsel against them and could not prevail over them.\n'),(28,67,'67',22,'22','Now therefore give you also advice against them by which we may prevail over them.\n'),(28,67,'67',23,'23','And Balaam answered the king, saying, Send now and call thy two counsellors, and we will see what their advice is upon this matter and afterward thy servant will speak.\n'),(28,67,'67',24,'24','And the king sent and called his two counsellors Reuel the Midianite and Job the Uzite, and they came and sat before the king.\n'),(28,67,'67',25,'25','And the king said to them, Behold you have both heard the dream which I have dreamed, and the interpretation thereof; now therefore give counsel and know and see what is to be done to the children of Israel,

forever.\n'),(28,67,'67',27,'27','If it seem good to the king, let him desist from the Hebrews and leave them, and let him not stretch forth his hand against them.\n'),(28,67,'67',28,'28','For these are they whom the Lord chose in days of old, and took as the lot of his inheritance from amongst all the nations of the earth and the kings of the earth; and who is there that stretched his hand against them with impunity, of whom their God was not avenged?\n'),(28,67,'67',29,'29','Surely thou knowest that when Abraham went down to Egypt, Pharaoh, the former king of Egypt, saw Sarah his wife, and took her for a wife, because Abraham said, She is my sister, for he was afraid, lest the men of Egypt should slay him on account of his wife.\n'),(28,67,'67',30,'30','And when the king of Egypt had taken Sarah then God smote him and his household with heavy plagues, until he restored unto Abraham his wife Sarah, then was he healed.\n'),(28,67,'67',31,'31','And Abimelech the Gerarite, king of the Philistines, God punished on account of Sarah wife of Abraham, in stopping up every womb from man to beast.\n'),(28,67,'67',32,'32','When their God came to Abimelech in the dream of night and terrified him in order that he might restore to Abraham Sarah whom he had taken, and afterward all the people of Gerar were punished on account of Sarah, and Abraham prayed to his God for them, and he was entreated of him, and he healed them.\n'),(28,67,'67',33,'33','And Abimelech feared all this evil that came upon him and his people, and he returned to Abraham his wife Sarah, and gave him with her many gifts.\n'),(28,67,'67',34,'34','He did so also to Isaac when he had driven him from Gerar, and God had done wonderful things to him, that all the water courses of Gerar were dried up, and their productive trees did not bring forth.\n'),(28,67,'67',35,'35','Until Abimelech of Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Pichol the captain of his host, went to him and they bent and bowed down before him to the ground.\n'),(28,67,'67',36,'36','And they requested of him to supplicate for them, and he prayed to the Lord for them, and the Lord was entreated of him and he healed them.\n'),(28,67,'67',37,'37','Jacob also, the plain man, was delivered through his integrity from the hand of his brother Esau, and the hand of Laban the Syrian his mother\'s brother, who had sought his life; likewise from the hand of all the kings of Canaan who had come together against him and his children to destroy them, and the Lord delivered them out of their hands, that they turned upon them and smote them, for who had ever stretched forth his hand against them with impunity?\n'),(28,67,'67',38,'38','Surely Pharaoh the former, thy father\'s father, raised Joseph the son of Jacob

to Midian, his land, and took Joseph\'s stick with him.\n'),(28,67,'67',42,'42','And the king said to Job the Uzite, What sayest thou Job, and what is thy advice respecting the Hebrews?\n'),(28,67,'67',43,'43','So Job said to the king, Behold all the inhabitants of the land are in thy power, let the king do as it seems good in his eyes.\n'),(28,67,'67',44,'44','And the king said unto Balaam, What dost thou say, Balaam, speak thy word that we may hear it.\n'),(28,67,'67',45,'45','And Balaam said to the king, Of all that the king has counselled against the Hebrews will they be delivered, and the king will not be able to prevail over them with any counsel.\n'),(28,67,'67',46,'46','For if thou thinkest to lessen them by the flaming fire, thou canst not prevail over them, for surely their God delivered Abraham their father from Ur of the Chaldeans; and if thou thinkest to destroy them with a sword, surely Isaac their father was delivered from it, and a ram was placed in his stead.\n'),(28,67,'67',47,'47','And if with hard and rigorous labor thou thinkest to lessen them, thou wilt not prevail even in this, for their father Jacob served Laban in all manner of

Go, and the young woman went and called the child\'s mother.\n'),(28,68,'68',23,'23','And Pharaoh\'s daughter said to Jochebed, Take this child away and suckle it for me, and I will pay thee thy wages, two bits of silver daily; and the woman took the child and nursed it.\n'),(28,68,'68',24,'24','And at the end of two years, when the child grew up, she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he was unto her as a son, and she called his name Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water.\n'),(28,68,'68',25,'25','And Amram his father called his name Chabar, for he said, It was for him that he associated with his wife whom he had turned away.\n'),(28,68,'68',26,'26','And Jochebed his mother called his name Jekuthiel, Because, she said, I have hoped for him to the Almighty, and God restored him unto me.\n'),(28,68,'68',27,'27','And Miriam his sister called him Jered, for she descended after him to the river to know what his end would be.\n'),(28,68,'68',28,'28','And Aaron his brother called his name Abi Zanuch, saying, My father left my mother and returned to her on his account.\n'),(28,68,'68',29,'29','And Kehath the father of Amram called his name Abigdor, because on his account did God repair the breach of the house of Jacob, that they could no longer throw their male children into the water.\n'),(28,68,'68',30,'30','And their nurse called him Abi Socho, saying, In his tabernacle was he hidden for three months, on account of the children of Ham.\n'),(28,68,'68',31,'31','And all Israel called his name Shemaiah, son of Nethanel, for they said, In his days has God heard their cries and rescued them from their oppressors.\n'),(28,68,'68',32,'32','And Moses was in Pharaoh\'s house, and was unto Bathia, Pharaoh\'s daughter, as a son, and Moses grew up amongst the king\'s children.\n'),(28,69,'69',1,'1','And the king of Edom died in those days, in the eighteenth year of his reign, and was buried in his temple which he had built for himself as his royal residence in the land of Edom.\n'),(28,69,'69',2,'2','And the children of Esau sent to Pethor, which is upon the river, and they fetched from there a young man of beautiful eyes and comely aspect, whose name was Saul, and they made him king over them in the place of Samlah.\n'),(28,69,'69',3,'3','And Saul reigned over all the children of Esau in the land of Edom for forty years.\n'),(28,69,'69',4,'4','And when Pharaoh king of Egypt saw that the counsel which Balaam had advised respecting the children of Israel did not succeed, but that still they were fruitful, multiplied and increased throughout the land of Egypt,\n'),(28,69,'69',5,'5','Then Pharaoh commanded in those days that a proclamation should be issued throughout Egypt to the children of Israel, saying, No man shall diminish any thing of his daily labor.\n'),(28,69,'69',6,'6','And the man who shall be found deficient in his labor which he performs daily, whether in mortar or in bricks, then his youngest son shall be put in their place.\n'),(28,69,'69',7,'7','And the labor of Egypt strengthened upon the children of Israel in those days, and behold if one brick was deficient in any man\'s daily labor, the Egyptians took his youngest boy by force from his mother, and put him into the building in the place of the brick which his father had left wanting.\n'),(28,69,'69',8,'8','And the men of Egypt did so to all the children of Israel day by day, all the days for a long period.\n'),(28,69,'69',9,'9','But the tribe of Levi did not at that time work with the Israelites their brethren, from the beginning, for the children of Levi knew the cunning of the Egyptians which they exercised at first toward the Israelites.\n'),(28,70,'70',1,'1','And in the third year from the birth of Moses, Pharaoh was sitting at a banquet, when Alparanith the queen was sitting at his right and Bathia at his left, and the lad Moses was lying upon her bosom, and Balaam the son of Beor with his two sons, and all the princes of the kingdom were sitting at table in the king\'s presence.\n'),(28,70,'70',2,'2','And the lad stretched forth his hand upon the king\'s head, and took the crown from the king\'s head and placed it on his own head.\n'),(28,70,'70',3,'3','And when the king and princes saw the work which the boy had done, the king and princes were terrified, and one man to his neighbor expressed astonishment.\n'),(28,70,'70',4,'4','And the king said unto the princes who were before him at table, What speak you and what say you, O ye princes, in this matter, and what is to be the judgment against the boy on account of this act?\n'),(28,70,'70',5,'5','And Balaam the son of Beor the magician answered before the king and princes, and he said, Remember now, O my lord and king, the dream which thou didst dream many days since, and that which thy servant interpreted unto thee.\n'),(28,70,'70',6,'6','Now therefore this is a child from the Hebrew children, in whom is the spirit of God, and let not my lord the king imagine that this youngster did this thing without knowledge.\n'),(28,70,'70',7,'7','For he is a Hebrew boy, and wisdom and understanding are with him, although he is yet a child, and with wisdom has he done this and chosen unto himself the kingdom of Egypt.\n'),(28,70,'70',8,'8','For this is the manner of all the Hebrews to deceive kings and their nobles, to do all these things cunningly, in order to make the kings of the earth and their men tremble.\n'),(28,70,'70',9,'9','Surely thou knowest that Abraham their father acted thus, who deceived the army of Nimrod king of Babel, and Abimelech king of Gerar, and that he possessed himself of the land of the children of Heth and all the kingdoms of Canaan.\n'),(28,70,'70',10,'10','And that he descended into Egypt and said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister, in order to mislead Egypt and her king.\n'),(28,70,'70',11,'11','His son Isaac also did so when he went to Gerar and dwelt there, and his strength prevailed over the army of Abimelech king of the Philistines.\n'),(28,70,'70',12,'12','He also thought of making the kingdom of the Philistines stumble, in saying that Rebecca his wife was his sister.\n'),(28,70,'70',13,'13','Jacob also dealt treacherously with his brother, and took from his hand his birthright and his blessing.\n'),(28,70,'70',14,'14','He went then to Padan-aram to the house of Laban his mother\'s brother, and cunningly obtained from him his daughter, his cattle, and all belonging to him, and fled away and returned to the land of Canaan to his father.\n'),(28,70,'70',15,'15','His sons sold their brother Joseph, who went down into Egypt and became a slave, and was placed in the prison house for twelve years.\n'),(28,70,'70',16,'16','Until the former Pharaoh dreamed dreams, and withdrew him from the prison house, and magnified him above all the princes in Egypt on account of his interpreting his dreams to him.\n'),(28,70,'70',17,'17','And when God caused a famine throughout the land he sent for and brought his father and all his brothers, and the whole of his father\'s household, and supported them without price or reward, and bought the Egyptians for slaves.\n'),(28,70,'70',18,'18','Now therefore my lord king behold this child has risen up in their stead in Egypt, to do according to their deeds and to trifle with every king, prince and judge.\n'),(28,70,'70',19,'19','If it please the king, let us now spill his blood upon the ground, lest he grow up and take away the government from thy hand, and the hope of Egypt perish after he shall have reigned.\n'),(28,70,'70',20,'20','And Balaam said to the king, Let us moreover call for all the judges of Egypt and the wise men thereof, and let us know if the judgment of death is due to this boy as thou didst say, and then we will slay him.\n'),(28,70,'70',21,'21','And Pharaoh sent and called for all the wise men of Egypt and they came before the king, and an angel of the Lord came amongst them, and he was like one of the wise men of Egypt.\n'),(28,70,'70',22,'22','And the king said to the wise men, Surely you have heard what this Hebrew boy who is in the house has done, and thus has Balaam judged in the matter.\n'),(28,70,'70',23,'23','Now judge you also and see what is due to the boy for the act he has committed.\n'),(28,70,'70',24,'24','And the angel, who seemed like one of the wise men of Pharaoh, answered and said as follows, before all the wise men of Egypt and before the king and the princes:\n'),(28,70,'70',25,'25','If it please the king let the king send for men who shall bring before him an onyx stone and a coal of fire, and place them before the child, and if the child shall stretch forth his hand and take the onyx stone, then shall we know that with wisdom has the youth done all that he has done, and we must slay him.\n'),(28,70,'70',26,'26','But if he stretch forth his hand upon the coal, then shall we know that it was not with knowledge that he did this thing, and he shall live.\n'),(28,70,'70',27,'27','And the thing seemed good in the eyes of the king and the princes, so the king did according to the word of the angel of the Lord.\n'),(28,70,'70',28,'28','And the king ordered the onyx stone and coal to be brought and placed before Moses.\n'),(28,70,'70',29,'29','And they placed the boy before them, and the lad endeavored to stretch forth his hand to the onyx stone, but the angel of the Lord took his hand and placed it upon the coal, and the coal became extinguished in his hand, and he lifted it up and put it into his mouth, and burned part of his lips and part of his tongue, and he became heavy in mouth and tongue.\n'),(28,70,'70',30,'30','And when the king and princes saw this, they knew that Moses had not acted with wisdom in taking off the crown from the king\'s head.\n'),(28,70,'70',31,'31','So the king and princes refrained from slaying the child, so Moses remained in Pharaoh\'s house, growing up, and the Lord was with him.\n'),(28,70,'70',32,'32','And whilst the boy was in the king\'s house, he was robed in purple and he grew amongst the children of the king.\n'),(28,70,'70',33,'33','And when Moses grew up in the king\'s house, Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh considered him as a son, and all the household of Pharaoh honored him, and all the men of Egypt were afraid of him.\n'),(28,70,'70',34,'34','And he daily went forth and came into the land of Goshen, where his brethren the children of Israel were, and Moses saw them daily in shortness of breath and hard labor.\n'),(28,70,'70',35,'35','And Moses asked them, saying, Wherefore is this labor meted out unto you day by day?\n'),(28,70,'70',36,'36','And they told him all that had befallen them, and all the injunctions which Pharaoh had put upon them before his birth.\n'),(28,70,'70',37,'37','And they told him all the counsels which Balaam the son of Beor had counselled against them, and what he had also counselled against him in order to slay him when he had taken the king\'s crown from off his head.\n'),(28,70,'70',38,'38','And when Moses heard these things his anger was kindled against Balaam, and he sought to kill him, and he was in ambush for him day by day.\n'),(28,70,'70',39,'39','And Balaam was afraid of Moses, and he and his two sons rose up and went forth from Egypt, and they fled and delivered their souls and betook themselves to the land of Cush to Kikianus, king of Cush.\n'),(28,70,'70',40,'40','And Moses was in the king\'s house going out and coming in, the Lord gave him favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants, and in the eyes of all the people of Egypt, and they loved Moses exceedingly.\n'),(28,70,'70',41,'41','And the day arrived when Moses went to Goshen to see his brethren, that he saw the children of Israel in their burdens and hard labor, and Moses was grieved on their account.\n'),(28,70,'70',42,'42','And Moses returned to Egypt and came to the house of Pharaoh, and came before the king, and Moses bowed down before the king.\n'),(28,70,'70',43,'43','And Moses said unto Pharaoh, I pray thee my lord, I have come to seek a small request from thee, turn not away my face empty; and Pharaoh said unto him, Speak.\n'),(28,70,'70',44,'44','And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Let there be given unto thy servants the children of Israel who are in Goshen, one day to rest therein from their labor.\n'),(28,70,'70',45,'45','And the king answered Moses and said, Behold I have lifted up thy face in this thing to grant thy request.\n'),(28,70,'70',46,'46','And Pharaoh ordered a proclamation to be issued throughout Egypt and Goshen, saying,\n'),(28,70,'70',47,'47','To you, all the children of Israel, thus says the king, for six days you shall do your work and labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest, and shall not preform any work, thus shall you do all the days, as the king and Moses the son of Bathia have commanded.\n'),(28,70,'70',48,'48','And Moses rejoiced at this thing which the king had granted to him, and all the children of Israel did as Moses ordered them.\n'),(28,70,'70',49,'49','For this thing was from the Lord to the children of Israel, for the Lord had begun to remember the children of Israel to save them for the sake of their fathers.\n'),(28,70,'70',50,'50','And the Lord was with Moses and his fame went throughout Egypt.\n'),(28,70,'70',51,'51','And Moses became great in the eyes of all the Egyptians, and in the eyes of all the children of Israel, seeking good for his people Israel and speaking words of peace regarding them to the king.\n'),(28,71,'71',1,'1','And when Moses was eighteen years old, he desired to see his father and mother and he went to them to Goshen, and when Moses had come near Goshen, he came to the place where the children of Israel were engaged in work, and he observed their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian smiting one of his Hebrew brethren.\n'),(28,71,'71',2,'2','And when the man who was beaten saw Moses he ran to him for help, for the man Moses was greatly respected in the house of Pharaoh, and he said to him, My lord attend to me, this Egyptian came to my house in the night, bound me, and came to my wife in my presence, and now he seeks to take my life away.\n'),(28,71,'71',3,'3','And when Moses heard this wicked thing, his anger was kindled against the Egyptian, and he turned this way and the other, and when he saw there was no man there he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand, and delivered the Hebrew from the hand of him that smote him.\n'),(28,71,'71',4,'4','And the Hebrew went to his house, and Moses returned to his home, and went forth and came back to the king\'s house.\n'),(28,71,'71',5,'5','And when the man had returned home, he thought of repudiating his wife, for it was not right in the house of Jacob, for any man to come to his wife after she had been defiled.\n'),(28,71,'71',6,'6','And the woman went and told her brothers, and the woman\'s brothers sought to slay him, and he fled to his house and escaped.\n'),(28,71,'71',7,'7','And on the second day Moses went forth to his brethren, and saw, and behold two men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, Why dost thou smite thy neighbor?\n'),(28,71,'71',8,'8','And he answered him and said to him, Who has set thee for a prince and judge over us? dost thou think to slay me as thou didst slay the Egyptian? and Moses was afraid and he said, Surely the thing is known?\n'),(28,71,'71',9,'9','And Pharaoh heard of this affair, and he ordered Moses to be slain, so God sent his angel, and he appeared unto Pharaoh in the likeness of a captain of the guard.\n'),(28,71,'71',10,'10','And the angel of the Lord took the sword from the hand of the captain of the guard, and took his head off with it, for the likeness of the captain of the guard was turned into the likeness of Moses.\n'),(28,71,'71',11,'11','And the angel of the Lord took hold of the right hand of Moses, and brought him forth from Egypt, and placed him from without the borders of Egypt, a distance of forty days\' journey.\n'),(28,71,'71',12,'12','And Aaron his brother alone remained in the land of Egypt, and he prophesied to the children of Israel, saying,\n'),(28,71,'71',13,'13','Thus says the Lord God of your ancestors, Throw away, each man, the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.\n'),(28,71,'71',14,'14','And the children of Israel rebelled and would not hearken to Aaron at that time.\n'),(28,71,'71',15,'15','And the Lord thought to destroy them, were it not that the Lord remembered the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\n'),(28,71,'71',16,'16','In those days the hand of Pharaoh continued to be severe against the children of Israel, and he crushed and oppressed them until the time when God sent forth his word and took notice of them.\n'),(28,72,'72',1,'1','And it was in those days that there was a great war between the children of Cush and the children of the east and Aram, and they rebelled against the king of Cush in whose hands they were.\n'),(28,72,'72',2,'2','So Kikianus king of Cush went forth with all the children of Cush, a people numerous as the sand, and he went to fight against Aram and the children of the east, to bring them under subjection.\n'),(28,72,'72',3,'3','And when Kikianus went out, he left Balaam the magician, with his two sons, to guard the city, and the lowest sort of the people of the land.\n'),(28,72,'72',4,'4','So Kikianus went forth to Aram and the children of the east, and he fought against them and smote them, and they all fell down wounded before Kikianus and his people.\n'),(28,72,'72',5,'5','And he took many of them captives and he brought them under subjection as at first, and he encamped upon their land to take tribute from them as usual.\n'),(28,72,'72',6,'6','And Balaam the son of Beor, when the king of Cush had left him to guard the city and the poor of the city, he rose up and advised with the people of the land to rebel against king Kikianus, not to let him enter the city when he should come home.\n'),(28,72,'72',7,'7','And the people of the land hearkened to him, and they swore to him and made him king over them, and his two sons for captains of the army.\n'),(28,72,'72',8,'8','So they rose up and raised the walls of the city at the two corners, and they built an exceeding strong building.\n'),(28,72,'72',9,'9','And at the third corner they dug ditches without number, between the city and the river which surrounded the whole land of Cush, and they made the waters of the river burst forth there.\n'),(28,72,'72',10,'10','At the fourth corner they collected numerous serpents by their incantations and enchantments, and they fortified the city and dwelt therein, and no one went out or in before them.\n'),(28,72,'72',11,'11','And Kikianus fought against Aram and the children of the east and he subdued them as before, and they gave him their usual tribute, and he went and returned to his land.\n'),(28,72,'72',12,'12','And when Kikianus the king of Cush approached his city and all the captains of the forces with him, they lifted up their eyes and saw that the walls of the city were built up and greatly elevated, so the men were astonished at this.\n'),(28,72,'72',13,'13','And they said one to the other, It is because they saw that we were delayed, in battle, and were greatly afraid of us, therefore have they done this thing and raised the city walls and fortified them so that the kings of Canaan might not come in battle against them.\n'),(28,72,'72',14,'14','So the king and the troops approached the city door and they looked up and behold, all the gates of the city were closed, and they called out to the sentinels, saying, Open unto us, that we may enter the city.\n'),(28,72,'72',15,'15','But the sentinels refused to open to them by the order of Balaam the magician, their king, they suffered them not to enter their city.\n'),(28,72,'72',16,'16','So they raised a battle with them opposite the city gate, and one hundred and thirty men of the army at Kikianus fell on that day.\n'),(28,72,'72',17,'17','And on the next day they continued to fight and they fought at the side of the river; they endeavored to pass but were not able, so some of them sank in the pits and died.\n'),(28,72,'72',18,'18','So the king ordered them to cut down trees to make rafts, upon which they might pass to them, and they did so.\n'),(28,72,'72',19,'19','And when they came to the place of the ditches, the waters revolved by mills, and two hundred men upon ten rafts were drowned.\n'),(28,72,'72',20,'20','And on the third day they came to fight at the side where the serpents were, but they could not approach there, for the serpents slew of them one hundred and seventy men, and they ceased fighting against Cush, and they besieged Cush for nine years, no person came out or in.\n'),(28,72,'72',21,'21','At that time that the war and the siege were against Cush, Moses fled from Egypt from Pharaoh who sought to kill him for having slain the Egyptian.\n'),(28,72,'72',22,'22','And Moses was eighteen years old when he fled from Egypt from the presence of Pharaoh, and he fled and escaped to the camp of Kikianus, which at that time was besieging Cush.\n'),(28,72,'72',23,'23','And Moses was nine years in the camp of Kikianus king of Cush, all the time that they were besieging Cush, and Moses went out and came in with them.\n'),(28,72,'72',24,'24','And the king and princes and all the fighting men loved Moses, for he was great and worthy, his stature was like a noble lion, his face was like the sun, and his strength was like that of a lion, and he was counsellor to the king.\n'),(28,72,'72',25,'25','And at the end of nine years, Kikianus was seized with a mortal disease, and his illness prevailed over him, and he died on the seventh day.\n'),(28,72,'72',26,'26','So his servants embalmed him and carried him and buried him opposite the city gate to the north of the land of Egypt.\n'),(28,72,'72',27,'27','And they built over him an elegant strong and high building, and they placed great stones below.\n'),(28,72,'72',28,'28','And the king\'s scribes engraved upon those stones all the might of their king Kikianus, and all his battles which he had fought, behold they are written there at this day.\n'),(28,72,'72',29,'29','Now after the death of Kikianus king of Cush it grieved his men and troops greatly on account of the war.\n'),(28,72,'72',30,'30','So they said one to the other, Give us counsel what we are to do at this time, as we have resided in the wilderness nine years away from our homes.\n'),(28,72,'72',31,'31','If we say we will fight against the city many of us will fall wounded or killed, and if we remain here in the siege we shall also die.\n'),(28,72,'72',32,'32','For now all the kings of Aram and of the children of the east will hear that our king is dead, and they will attack us suddenly in a hostile manner, and they will fight against us and leave no remnant of us.\n'),(28,72,'72',33,'33','Now therefore let us go and make a king over us, and let us remain in the siege until the city is delivered up to us.\n'),(28,72,'72',34,'34','And they wished to choose on that day a man for king from the army of Kikianus, and they found no object of their choice like Moses to reign over them.\n'),(28,72,'72',35,'35','And they hastened and stripped off each man his garments and cast them upon the ground, and they made a great heap and placed Moses thereon.\n'),(28,72,'72',36,'36','And they rose up and blew with trumpets and called out before him, and said, May the king live, may the king live!\n'),(28,72,'72',37,'37','And all the people and nobles swore unto him to give him for a wife Adoniah the queen, the Cushite, wife of Kikianus, and they made Moses king over them on that day.\n'),(28,72,'72',38,'38','And all the people of Cush issued a proclamation on that day, saying, Every man must give something to Moses of what is in his possession.\n'),(28,72,'72',39,'39','And they spread out a sheet upon the heap, and every man cast into it something of what he had, one a gold earring and the other a coin.\n'),(28,72,'72',40,'40','Also of onyx stones, bdellium, pearls and marble did the children of Cush cast unto Moses upon the heap, also silver and gold in great abundance.\n'),(28,72,'72',41,'41','And Moses took all the silver and gold, all the vessels, and the bdellium and onyx stones, which all the children of Cush had given to him, and he placed them amongst his treasures.\n'),(28,72,'72',42,'42','And Moses reigned over the children of Cush on that day, in the place of Kikianus king of Cush.\n'),(28,73,'73',1,'1','In the fifty-fifth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, that is in the hundred and fifty-seventh year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, reigned Moses in Cush.\n'),(28,73,'73',2,'2','Moses was twenty-seven years old when he began to reign over Cush, and forty years did he reign.\n'),(28,73,'73',3,'3','And the Lord granted Moses favor and grace in the eyes of all the children of Cush, and the children of Cush loved him exceedingly, so Moses was favored by the Lord and by men.\n'),(28,73,'73',4,'4','And in the seventh day of his reign, all the children of Cush assembled and came before Moses and bowed down to him to the ground.\n'),(28,73,'73',5,'5','And all the children spoke together in the presence of the king, saying, Give us counsel that we may see what is to be done to this city.\n'),(28,73,'73',6,'6','For it is now nine years that we have been besieging round about the city, and have not seen our children and our wives.\n'),(28,73,'73',7,'7','So the king answered them, saying, If you will hearken to my voice in all that I shall command you, then will the Lord give the city into our hands and we shall subdue it.\n'),(28,73,'73',8,'8','For if we fight with them as in the former battle which we had with them before the death of Kikianus, many of us will fall down wounded as before.\n'),(28,73,'73',9,'9','Now therefore behold here is counsel for you in this matter; if you will hearken to my voice, then will the city be delivered into our hands.\n'),(28,73,'73',10,'10','So all the forces answered the king, saying, All that our lord shall command that will we do.\n'),(28,73,'73',11,'11','And Moses said unto them, Pass through and proclaim a voice in the whole camp unto all the people, saying,\n'),(28,73,'73',12,'12','Thus says the king, Go into the forest and bring with you of the young ones of the stork, each man a young one in his hand.\n'),(28,73,'73',13,'13','And any person transgressing the word of the king, who shall not bring his young one, he shall die, and the king will take all belonging to

ones of the hawk.\n'),(28,73,'73',15,'15','So all the children of Cush heard the words of Moses, and they rose up and caused a proclamation to be issued throughout the camp,

people did so, and they went out to the wood and they climbed the fir trees and caught, each man a young one in his hand, all the young of the storks, and they brought them into the desert and reared them by order of the king, and they taught them to dart upon, similar to the young hawks.\n'),(28,73,'73',19,'19','And after the young storks were reared, the king ordered them to be hungered for three days, and all the people did so.\n'),(28,73,'73',20,'20','And on the third day, the king said unto them, strengthen yourselves and become valiant men, and put on each man his armor and gird on his sword upon him, and ride each man his horse and take each his young stork in his hand.\n'),(28,73,'73',21,'21','And we will rise up and fight against the city at the place where the serpents are;

said to them, Send forth each man his young stork upon the serpents.\n'),(28,73,'73',23,'23','And they sent forth each man his young stork at the king\'s order, and the young storks ran upon the serpents and they devoured them all and destroyed them out of that place.\n'),(28,73,'73',24,'24','And when the king and people had seen that all the serpents were destroyed in that place, all the people set up a great shout.\n'),(28,73,'73',25,'25','And they approached and fought against the city and took it and subdued it, and they entered the city.\n'),(28,73,'73',26,'26','And there died on that day one thousand and one hundred men of the people of the city, all that inhabited the city, but of the people besieging not one died.\n'),(28,73,'73',27,'27','So all the children of Cush went each to his home, to his wife and children and to all belonging to him.\n'),(28,73,'73',28,'28','And Balaam the magician, when he saw that the city was taken, he opened the gate and he and his two

Cush.\n'),(28,73,'73',31,'31','And they placed the royal crown upon his head, and they gave him for a wife Adoniah the Cushite queen, wife of Kikianus.\n'),(28,73,'73',32,'32','And Moses feared the Lord God of his fathers, so that he came not to her, nor did he turn his eyes to her.\n'),(28,73,'73',33,'33','For Moses remembered how Abraham had made his servant Eliezer swear, saying unto him,

walked.\n'),(28,73,'73',38,'38','And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and he guided the children of Cush with his usual wisdom, and Moses prospered in his

east.\n'),(28,73,'73',41,'41','And they went at first to the children of the east, and when the children of the east heard their report, they went to meet them, and engaged in battle with them.\n'),(28,73,'73',42,'42','And the war was severe against the children of the east, so the Lord gave all the children of the east into the hand of Moses, and about three hundred men fell down slain.\n'),(28,73,'73',43,'43','And all the children of the east turned back and retreated, so Moses and the children of Cush followed them and subdued them, and put a tax upon them, as was their custom.\n'),(28,73,'73',44,'44','So Moses and all the people with him passed from there to the land of Aram for battle.\n'),(28,73,'73',45,'45','And the people of Aram also went to meet them, and they fought against them, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Moses, and many of the men of Aram fell down wounded.\n'),(28,73,'73',46,'46','And Aram also were subdued by Moses and the people of Cush, and also gave their usual tax.\n'),(28,73,'73',47,'47','And Moses brought Aram and the children of the east under subjection to the children of Cush, and Moses and all the people who were with him, turned to the land of Cush.\n'),(28,73,'73',48,'48','And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and the Lord was with him, and all the children of Cush were afraid of

upon his father\'s throne to reign over Egypt, and he conducted the government of Egypt in his wisdom.\n'),(28,77,'77',8,'8','And whilst he reigned he exceeded his father and all the preceding kings in wickedness, and he increased his yoke over the children of Israel.\n'),(28,77,'77',9,'9','And he went with his servants to Goshen to the children of Israel, and he strengthened the labor over them and he said unto them, Complete your work, each day\'s task, and let not your hands slacken from our work from this day forward as you did in the days of my father.\n'),(28,77,'77',10,'10','And he placed officers over them from amongst the children of Israel, and over these officers he placed taskmasters from amongst his servants.\n'),(28,77,'77',11,'11','And he placed over them a measure of bricks for them to do according to that number, day by day, and he turned back and went to Egypt.\n'),(28,77,'77',12,'12','At that time the task-masters of Pharaoh ordered the officers of the children of Israel according to the command of Pharaoh, saying,\n'),(28,77,'77',13,'13','Thus says Pharaoh, Do your work each day, and finish your task, and observe the daily measure of bricks; diminish not anything.\n'),(28,77,'77',14,'14','And it shall come to pass that if you are deficient in your daily bricks, I will put your young children in their stead.\n'),(28,77,'77',15,'15','And the task-masters of Egypt did so in those days as Pharaoh had ordered them.\n'),(28,77,'77',16,'16','And whenever any deficiency was found in the children of Israel\'s measure of their daily bricks, the task-masters of Pharaoh would go to the wives of the children of Israel and take infants of the children of Israel to the number of bricks deficient, they would take them by force from their mother\'s laps, and put them in the building instead of the bricks;\n'),(28,77,'77',17,'17','Whilst their fathers and mothers were crying over them and weeping when they heard the weeping voices of their infants in the wall of the building.\n'),(28,77,'77',18,'18','And the task-masters prevailed over Israel, that the Israelites should place their children in the building, so that a man placed his son in the wall and put mortar over him, whilst his eyes wept over him, and his tears ran down upon his child.\n'),(28,77,'77',19,'19','And the task-masters of Egypt did so to the babes of Israel for many days, and no one pitied or had compassion over the babes of the children of Israel.\n'),(28,77,'77',20,'20','And the number of all the children killed in the building was two hundred and seventy, some whom they had built upon instead of the bricks which had been left deficient by their fathers, and some whom they had drawn out dead from the building.\n'),(28,77,'77',21,'21','And the labor imposed upon the children of Israel in the days of Adikam exceeded in hardship that which they performed in the days of his father.\n'),(28,77,'77',22,'22','And the children of Israel sighed every day on account of their heavy work, for they had said to themselves, Behold when Pharaoh shall die, his son will rise up and lighten our work!\n'),(28,77,'77',23,'23','But they increased the latter work more than the former, and the children of Israel sighed at this and their cry ascended to God on account of their labor.\n'),(28,77,'77',24,'24','And God heard the voice of the children of Israel and their cry, in those days, and God remembered to them his covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\n'),(28,77,'77',25,'25','And God saw the burden of the children of Israel, and their heavy work in those days, and he determined to deliver them.\n'),(28,77,'77',26,'26','And Moses the son of Amram was still confined in the dungeon in those days, in the house of Reuel the Midianite, and Zipporah the daughter of Reuel did support him with food secretly day by day.\n'),(28,77,'77',27,'27','And Moses was confined in the dungeon in the house of Reuel for ten years.\n'),(28,77,'77',28,'28','And at the end of ten years which was the first year of the reign of Pharaoh over Egypt, in the place of his father,\n'),(28,77,'77',29,'29','Zipporah said to her father Reuel, No person inquires or seeks after the Hebrew man, whom thou didst bind in prison now ten years.\n'),(28,77,'77',30,'30','Now therefore, if it seem good in thy sight, let us send and see whether he is living or dead, but her father knew not that she had supported him.\n'),(28,77,'77',31,'31','And Reuel her father answered and said to her, Has ever such a thing happened that a man should be shut up in a prison without food for ten years, and that he should live?\n'),(28,77,'77',32,'32','And Zipporah answered her father, saying, Surely thou hast heard that the God of the Hebrews is great and awful, and does wonders for them at all times.\n'),(28,77,'77',33,'33','He it was who delivered Abraham from Ur of the Chaldeans, and Isaac from the sword of his father, and Jacob from the angel of the Lord who wrestled with him at the ford of Jabbuk.\n'),(28,77,'77',34,'34','Also with this man has he done many things, he delivered him from the river in Egypt and from the sword of Pharaoh, and from the children of Cush, so also can he deliver him from famine and make him live.\n'),(28,77,'77',35,'35','And the thing seemed good in the sight of Reuel, and he did according to the word of his daughter, and sent to the dungeon to ascertain what became of Moses.\n'),(28,77,'77',36,'36','And he saw, and behold the man Moses was living in the dungeon, standing upon his feet, praising and praying to the God of his ancestors.\n'),(28,77,'77',37,'37','And Reuel commanded Moses to be brought out of the dungeon, so they shaved him and he changed his prison garments and ate bread.\n'),(28,77,'77',38,'38','And afterward Moses went into the garden of Reuel which was behind the house, and he there prayed to the Lord his God, who had done mighty wonders for him.\n'),(28,77,'77',39,'39','And it was that whilst he prayed he looked opposite to him, and behold a sapphire stick was placed in the ground, which was planted in the midst of the garden.\n'),(28,77,'77',40,'40','And he approached the stick and he looked, and behold the name of the Lord God of hosts was engraved thereon, written and developed upon the stick.\n'),(28,77,'77',41,'41','And he read it and stretched forth his hand and he plucked it like a forest tree from the thicket, and the stick was in his hand.\n'),(28,77,'77',42,'42','And this is the stick with which all the works of our God were performed, after he had created heaven and earth, and all the host of them, seas, rivers and all their fishes.\n'),(28,77,'77',43,'43','And when God had driven Adam from the garden of Eden, he took the stick in his hand and went and tilled the ground from which he was taken.\n'),(28,77,'77',44,'44','And the stick came down to Noah and was given to Shem and his descendants, until it came into the hand of Abraham the Hebrew.\n'),(28,77,'77',45,'45','And when Abraham had given all he had to his son Isaac, he also gave to him this stick.\n'),(28,77,'77',46,'46','And when Jacob had fled to Padan-aram, he took it into his hand, and when he returned to his father he had not left it behind him.\n'),(28,77,'77',47,'47','Also when he went down to Egypt he took it into his hand and gave it to Joseph, one portion above his brethren, for Jacob had taken it by force from his brother Esau.\n'),(28,77,'77',48,'48','And after the death of Joseph, the nobles of Egypt came into the house of Joseph, and the stick came into the hand of Reuel the Midianite, and when he went out of Egypt, he took it in his hand and planted it in his garden.\n'),(28,77,'77',49,'49','And all the mighty men of the Kinites tried to pluck it when they endeavored to get Zipporah his daughter, but they were unsuccessful.\n'),(28,77,'77',50,'50','So that stick remained planted in the garden of Reuel, until he came who had a right to it and took it.\n'),(28,77,'77',51,'51','And when Reuel saw the stick in the hand of Moses, he wondered at it, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah for a wife.\n'),(28,78,'78',1,'1','At that time died Baal Channan son of Achbor, king of Edom, and was buried in his house in the land of Edom.\n'),(28,78,'78',2,'2','And after his death the children of Esau sent to the land of Edom, and took from there a man who was in Edom, whose name was Hadad, and they made him king over them in the

of Egypt greatly increased the labor of the children of Israel in those days, and continued to make his yoke heavier upon the children of Israel.\n'),(28,78,'78',12,'12','And he ordered a proclamation

Egyptians oppressed them.\n'),(28,78,'78',16,'16','And the Lord was jealous of his people and his inheritance, and heard their voice, and he resolved to take them out of the affliction of Egypt, to give them the land of Canaan for a possession.\n'),(28,79,'79',1,'1','And in those days Moses was feeding the flock of Reuel the Midianite his father-in-law, beyond the wilderness of Sin, and the stick which he took from his father-in-law was in his hand.\n'),(28,79,'79',2,'2','And it came to pass one day that a kid of goats strayed from the flock, and Moses pursued it and it came to the

signs and wonders in Egypt before the eyes of Pharaoh and the eyes of his subjects, in order that they might believe that the Lord had sent him.\n'),(28,79,'79',7,'7','And Moses hearkened to all that the Lord had commanded him, and he returned to his father-in-law and told him the thing, and Reuel said to him, Go in peace.\n'),(28,79,'79',8,'8','And Moses rose up to go to Egypt, and he took his wife and sons with him, and he was at an inn in the road, and an angel of God came down, and sought an occasion against him.\n'),(28,79,'79',9,'9','And he wished to kill him on account of his first born son, because he had not circumcised him, and had transgressed the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham.\n'),(28,79,'79',10,'10','For Moses had hearkened to the words of his father-in-law

circumcised her son, and delivered her husband and her son from the hand of the angel of the Lord.\n'),(28,79,'79',13,'13','And Aaron the son of Amram, the brother of Moses, was in Egypt walking at the river side on that day.\n'),(28,79,'79',14,'14','And the Lord appeared to him in that place, and he said to him, Go now toward Moses in the wilderness, and he went and met him in the mountain of

so.\n'),(28,79,'79',18,'18','And Zipporah returned with her children, and they went to the house of Reuel, and remained there until the time arrived when the Lord had visited his people, and brought them forth from Egypt from the hand at Pharaoh.\n'),(28,79,'79',19,'19','And Moses and Aaron came to Egypt to the community of the children of Israel, and they spoke to them all the words of the Lord,

us to thee, to say, Send forth my people that they may serve me.\n'),(28,79,'79',26,'26','And when Pharaoh heard their words he was greatly terrified before them, and he said to them, Go today and

over all Egypt.\n'),(28,80,'80',30,'30','And the Lord sent a very heavy hail, which smote their vines and broke their fruit trees and dried them up that they fell upon them.\n'),(28,80,'80',31,'31','Also every green herb became dry and perished, for a mingling fire descended amidst the hail, therefore the hail and the fire consumed all things.\n'),(28,80,'80',32,'32','Also men and beasts that were found abroad perished of the flames of fire and of the hail, and all the young lions were exhausted.\n'),(28,80,'80',33,'33','And the Lord sent and brought numerous locusts into Egypt, the Chasel, Salom, Chargol, and Chagole, locusts each of its kind, which devoured all that the hail had left remaining.\n'),(28,80,'80',34,'34','Then the Egyptians rejoiced at the locusts, although they consumed the produce of the field, and they caught them in abundance and salted them for food.\n'),(28,80,'80',35,'35','And the Lord turned a mighty wind of the sea which took away all the locusts, even those that were salted, and thrust them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained within the boundaries of Egypt.\n'),(28,80,'80',36,'36','And God sent darkness upon Egypt, that the whole land of Egypt and Pathros became dark for three days, so that a man could not see his hand when he lifted it to his mouth.\n'),(28,80,'80',37,'37','At that time died many of the people of Israel who had rebelled against the Lord and who would not hearken to Moses and Aaron, and believed not in them that God had sent them.\n'),(28,80,'80',38,'38','And who had said, We will not go forth from Egypt lest we perish with hunger in a desolate wilderness, and who would not hearken to the voice of Moses.\n'),(28,80,'80',39,'39','And the Lord plagued them in the three days of darkness, and the Israelites buried them in those days, without the Egyptians knowing of them or rejoicing over them.\n'),(28,80,'80',40,'40','And the darkness was very great in Egypt for three days, and any person who was standing when the darkness came, remained standing in his place, and he that was sitting remained sitting, and he that was lying continued lying in the same state, and he that was walking remained sitting upon the ground in the same spot; and this thing happened to all the Egyptians, until the darkness had passed away.\n'),(28,80,'80',41,'41','And the days of darkness passed away, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron to the children of Israel, saying, Celebrate your feast and make your Passover, for behold I come in the midst of the night amongst all the Egyptians, and I will smite all their first born, from the first born of a man to the first born of a beast, and when I see your Passover, I will pass over you.\n'),(28,80,'80',42,'42','And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, thus did they in that night.\n'),(28,80,'80',43,'43','And it came to pass in the middle of the night, that the Lord went forth in the midst of Egypt, and smote all the first born of the Egyptians, from the first born of man to the first born of beast.\n'),(28,80,'80',44,'44','And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry throughout Egypt in that night, for there was not a house in which there was not a corpse.\n'),(28,80,'80',45,'45','Also the likenesses of the first born of Egypt, which were carved in the walls at their houses, were destroyed and fell to the ground.\n'),(28,80,'80',46,'46','Even the bones of their first born who had died before this and whom they had buried in their houses, were raked up by the dogs of Egypt on that night and dragged before the Egyptians and cast before them.\n'),(28,80,'80',47,'47','And all the Egyptians saw this evil which had suddenly come upon them, and all the Egyptians cried out with a loud voice.\n'),(28,80,'80',48,'48','And all the families of Egypt wept upon that night, each man for his son and each man for his daughter, being the first born, and the tumult of Egypt was heard at a distance on that night.\n'),(28,80,'80',49,'49','And Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh went forth with the king on that night to seek Moses and Aaron in their houses, and they found them in their houses, eating and drinking and rejoicing with all Israel.\n'),(28,80,'80',50,'50','And Bathia said to Moses, Is this the reward for the good which I have done to thee, who have reared thee and stretched thee out, and thou hast brought this evil upon me and my father\'s house?\n'),(28,80,'80',51,'51','And Moses said to her, Surely ten plagues did the Lord bring upon Egypt; did any evil accrue to thee from any of them? did one of them affect thee? and she said, No.\n'),(28,80,'80',52,'52','And Moses said to her, Although thou art the first born to thy mother, thou shalt not die, and no evil shall reach thee in the midst of Egypt.\n'),(28,80,'80',53,'53','And she said, What advantage is it to me, when I see the king, my brother, and all his household and subjects in this evil, whose first born perish with all the first born of Egypt?\n'),(28,80,'80',54,'54','And Moses said to her, Surely thy brother and his household, and subjects, the families of Egypt, would not hearken to the words of the Lord, therefore did this evil come upon them.\n'),(28,80,'80',55,'55','And Pharaoh king of Egypt approached Moses and Aaron, and some of the children of Israel who were with them in that place, and he prayed to them, saying,\n'),(28,80,'80',56,'56','Rise up and take your brethren, all the children of Israel who are in the land, with their sheep and oxen, and all belonging to them, they shall leave nothing remaining, only pray for me to the Lord your God.\n'),(28,80,'80',57,'57','And Moses said to Pharaoh, Behold though thou art thy mother\'s first born, yet fear not, for thou wilt not die, for the Lord has commanded that thou shalt live, in order to show thee his great might and strong stretched out arm.\n'),(28,80,'80',58,'58','And Pharaoh ordered the children of Israel to be sent away, and all the Egyptians strengthened themselves to send them, for they said, We are all perishing.\n'),(28,80,'80',59,'59','And all the Egyptians sent the Israelites forth, with great riches, sheep and oxen and precious things, according to the oath of the Lord between him and our Father Abraham.\n'),(28,80,'80',60,'60','And the children of Israel delayed going forth at night, and when the Egyptians came to them to bring them out, they said to them, Are we thieves, that we should go forth at night?\n'),(28,80,'80',61,'61','And the children of Israel asked of the Egyptians, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and the children of Israel stripped the Egyptians.\n'),(28,80,'80',62,'62','And Moses hastened and rose up and went to the river of Egypt, and brought up from thence the coffin of Joseph and took it with him.\n'),(28,80,'80',63,'63','The children of Israel also brought up, each man his father\'s coffin with him, and each man the coffins of his tribe.\n'),(28,81,'81',1,'1','And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides the little ones and their wives.\n'),(28,81,'81',2,'2','Also a mixed multitude went up with them, and flocks and herds, even much cattle.\n'),(28,81,'81',3,'3','And the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Egypt in hard labor, was two hundred and ten years.\n'),(28,81,'81',4,'4','And at the end of two hundred and ten years, the Lord brought forth the children of Israel from Egypt with a strong hand.\n'),(28,81,'81',5,'5','And the children of Israel traveled from Egypt and from Goshen and from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth on the fifteenth day of the first month.\n'),(28,81,'81',6,'6','And the Egyptians buried all their first born whom the Lord had smitten, and all the Egyptians buried their slain for three days.\n'),(28,81,'81',7,'7','And the children of Israel traveled from Succoth and encamped in Ethom, at the end of the wilderness.\n'),(28,81,'81',8,'8','And on the third day after the Egyptians had buried their first born, many men rose up from Egypt and went after Israel to make them return to Egypt, for they repented that they had sent the Israelites away from their servitude.\n'),(28,81,'81',9,'9','And one man said to his neighbor, Surely Moses and Aaron spoke to Pharaoh, saying, We will go a three days\' journey in the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God.\n'),(28,81,'81',10,'10','Now therefore let us rise up early in the morning and cause them to return, and it shall be that if they return with us to Egypt to their masters, then shall we know that there is faith in them, but if they will not return, then will we fight with them, and make them come back with great power and a strong hand.\n'),(28,81,'81',11,'11','And all the nobles of Pharaoh rose up in the morning, and with them about seven hundred thousand men, and they went forth from Egypt on that day, and came to the place where the children of Israel were.\n'),(28,81,'81',12,'12','And all the Egyptians saw and behold Moses and Aaron and all the children of Israel were sitting before Pi-hahiroth, eating and drinking and celebrating the feast of the Lord.\n'),(28,81,'81',13,'13','And all the Egyptians said to the children of Israel, Surely you said, We will go a journey for three days in the wilderness and sacrifice to our God and return.\n'),(28,81,'81',14,'14','Now therefore this day makes five days since you went, why do you not return to your masters?\n'),(28,81,'81',15,'15','And Moses and Aaron answered them, saying, Because the Lord our God has testified in us, saying, You shall no more return to Egypt, but we will betake ourselves to a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord our God had sworn to our ancestors to give to us.\n'),(28,81,'81',16,'16','And when the nobles of Egypt saw that the children of Israel did not hearken to them, to return to Egypt, they girded themselves to fight with Israel.\n'),(28,81,'81',17,'17','And the Lord strengthened the hearts of the children of Israel over the Egyptians, that they gave them a severe beating, and the battle was sore upon the Egyptians, and all the Egyptians fled from before the children of Israel, for many of them perished by the hand of Israel.\n'),(28,81,'81',18,'18','And the nobles of Pharaoh went to Egypt and told Pharaoh, saying, The children of Israel have fled, and will no more return to Egypt, and in this manner did Moses and Aaron speak to us.\n'),(28,81,'81',19,'19','And Pharaoh heard this thing, and his heart and the hearts of all his subjects were turned against Israel, and they repented that they had sent Israel; and all the Egyptians advised Pharaoh to pursue the children of Israel to make them come back to their burdens.\n'),(28,81,'81',20,'20','And they said each man to his brother, What is this which we have done, that we have sent Israel from our servitude?\n'),(28,81,'81',21,'21','And the Lord strengthened the hearts of all the Egyptians to pursue the Israelites, for the Lord desired to overthrow the Egyptians in the Red Sea.\n'),(28,81,'81',22,'22','And Pharaoh rose up and harnessed his chariot, and he ordered all the Egyptians to assemble, not one man was left excepting the little ones and the women.\n'),(28,81,'81',23,'23','And all the Egyptians went forth with Pharaoh to pursue the children of Israel, and the camp of Egypt was an exceedingly large and heavy camp, about ten hundred thousand men.\n'),(28,81,'81',24,'24','And the whole of this camp went and pursued the children of Israel to bring them back to Egypt, and they reached them encamping by the Red Sea.\n'),(28,81,'81',25,'25','And the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and beheld all the Egyptians pursuing them, and the children of Israel were greatly terrified at them, and the children of Israel cried to the Lord.\n'),(28,81,'81',26,'26','And on account of the Egyptians, the children of Israel divided themselves into four divisions, and they were divided in their opinions, for they were afraid of the Egyptians, and Moses spoke to each of them.\n'),(28,81,'81',27,'27','The first division was of the children of Reuben, Simeon, and Issachar, and they resolved to cast themselves into the sea, for they were exceedingly afraid of the Egyptians.\n'),(28,81,'81',28,'28','And Moses said to them, Fear not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which He will effect this day for you.\n'),(28,81,'81',29,'29','The second division was of the children of Zebulun, Benjamin and Naphtali, and they resolved to go back to Egypt with the Egyptians.\n'),(28,81,'81',30,'30','And Moses said to them, Fear not, for as you have seen the Egyptians this day, so shall you see them no more for ever.\n'),(28,81,'81',31,'31','The third division was of the children of Judah and Joseph, and they resolved to go to meet the Egyptians to fight with them.\n'),(28,81,'81',32,'32','And Moses said to them, Stand in your places, for the Lord will fight for you, and you shall remain silent.\n'),(28,81,'81',33,'33','And the fourth division was of the children of Levi, Gad, and Asher, and they resolved to go into the midst of the Egyptians to confound them, and Moses said to them, Remain in your stations and fear not, only call unto the Lord that he may save you out of their hands.\n'),(28,81,'81',34,'34','After this Moses rose up from amidst the people, and he prayed to the Lord and said,\n'),(28,81,'81',35,'35','O Lord God of the whole earth, save now thy people whom thou didst bring forth from Egypt, and let not the Egyptians boast that power and might are theirs.\n'),(28,81,'81',36,'36','So the Lord said to Moses, Why dost thou cry unto me? speak to the children of Israel that they shall proceed, and do thou stretch out thy rod upon the sea and divide it, and the children of Israel shall pass through it.\n'),(28,81,'81',37,'37','And Moses did so, and he lifted up his rod upon the sea and divided it.\n'),(28,81,'81',38,'38','And the waters of the sea were divided into twelve parts, and the children of Israel passed through on foot, with shoes, as a man would pass through a prepared road.\n'),(28,81,'81',39,'39','And the Lord manifested to the children of Israel his wonders in Egypt and in the sea by the hand of Moses and Aaron.\n'),(28,81,'81',40,'40','And when the children of Israel had entered the sea, the Egyptians came after them, and the waters of the sea resumed upon them, and they all sank in the water, and not one man was left excepting Pharaoh, who gave thanks to the Lord and believed in him, therefore the Lord did not cause him to perish at that time with the Egyptians.\n'),(28,81,'81',41,'41','And the Lord ordered an angel to take him from amongst the Egyptians, who cast him upon the land of Ninevah and he reigned over it for a long time.\n'),(28,81,'81',42,'42','And on that day the Lord saved Israel from the hand of Egypt, and all the children of Israel saw that the Egyptians had perished, and they beheld the great hand of the Lord, in what he had performed in Egypt and in the sea.\n'),(28,81,'81',43,'43','Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, on the day when the Lord caused the Egyptians to fall before them.\n'),(28,81,'81',44,'44','And all Israel sang in concert, saying, I will sing to the Lord for He is greatly exalted, the horse and his rider has he cast into the sea; behold it is written in the book of the law of God.\n'),(28,81,'81',45,'45','After this the children of Israel proceeded on their journey, and encamped in Marah, and the Lord gave to the children of Israel statutes and judgments in that place in Marah, and the Lord commanded the children of Israel to walk in all his ways and to serve him.\n'),(28,81,'81',46,'46','And they journeyed from Marah and came to Elim, and in Elim were twelve springs of water and seventy date trees, and the children encamped there by the waters.\n'),(28,81,'81',47,'47','And they journeyed from Elim and came to the wilderness of Sin, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from Egypt.\n'),(28,81,'81',48,'48','At that time the Lord gave the manna to the children of Israel to eat, and the Lord caused food to rain from heaven for the children of Israel day by day.\n'),(28,81,'81',49,'49','And the children of Israel ate the manna for forty years, all the days that they were in the wilderness, until they came to the land of Canaan to possess it.\n'),(28,81,'81',50,'50','And they proceeded from the wilderness of Sin and encamped in Alush.\n'),(28,81,'81',51,'51','And they proceeded from Alush and encamped in Rephidim.\n'),(28,81,'81',52,'52','And when the children of Israel were in Rephidim, Amalek the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, the brother of Zepho, came to fight with Israel.\n'),(28,81,'81',53,'53','And he brought with him eight hundred and one thousand men, magicians and conjurers, and he prepared for battle with Israel in Rephidim.\n'),(28,81,'81',54,'54','And they carried on a great and severe battle against Israel, and the Lord delivered Amalek and his people into the hands of Moses and the children of Israel, and into the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun, the Ephrathite, the servant of Moses.\n'),(28,81,'81',55,'55','And the children of Israel smote Amalek and his people at the edge of the sword, but the battle was very sore upon the children of Israel.\n'),(28,81,'81',56,'56','And the Lord said to Moses, Write this thing as a memorial for thee in a book, and place it in the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun, thy servant, and thou shalt command the children of Israel, saying, When thou shalt come to the land of Canaan, thou shalt utterly efface the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n'),(28,81,'81',57,'57','And Moses did so, and he took the book and wrote upon it these words, saying,\n'),(28,81,'81',58,'58','Remember what Amalek has done to thee in the road when thou wentest forth from Egypt.\n'),(28,81,'81',59,'59','Who met thee in the road and smote thy rear, even those that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary.\n'),(28,81,'81',60,'60','Therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven, thou shalt not forget it.\n'),(28,81,'81',61,'61','And the king who shall have pity on Amalek, or upon his memory or upon his seed, behold I will require it of him, and I will cut him off from amongst his people.\n'),(28,81,'81',62,'62','And Moses wrote all these things in a book, and he enjoined the children of Israel respecting all these matters.\n'),(28,82,'82',1,'1','And the children of Israel proceeded from Rephidim and they encamped in the wilderness of Sinai, in the third month from their going forth from Egypt.\n'),(28,82,'82',2,'2','At that time came Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, with Zipporah his daughter and her two sons, for he had heard of the wonders of the Lord which he had done to Israel, that he had delivered them from the hand of

great honor, and all Israel was with him.\n'),(28,82,'82',5,'5','And Reuel and his children remained amongst the Israelites for many days, and Reuel knew the Lord from that day forward.\n'),(28,82,'82',6,'6','And in the third month from the children of Israel\'s departure from Egypt, on the sixth day thereof, the Lord gave to Israel the ten commandments on Mount

god who shall go before us, so that thou shalt not die.\n'),(28,82,'82',14,'14','And Aaron was greatly afraid of the people, and he ordered them to bring him gold and he made it into a molten calf for the people.\n'),(28,82,'82',15,'15','And the Lord said to Moses, before he had come down from the mount, Get thee down, for thy people whom thou didst bring forth from Egypt have corrupted themselves.\n'),(28,82,'82',16,'16','They have made to themselves a molten calf, and have bowed down to it, now therefore leave me, that I may consume them from off the earth, for they are a stiffnecked people.\n'),(28,82,'82',17,'17','And Moses besought the countenance of the Lord, and he prayed to the Lord for the people on account of the calf which they had made, and he afterward descended from the mount and in his hands were the two tablets of stone, which God had given him to command the Israelites.\n'),(28,82,'82',18,'18','And when Moses approached the camp and saw the calf which the people had made, the anger of Moses was kindled and he broke the tablets under the mount.\n'),(28,82,'82',19,'19','And Moses came to the camp and he took the calf and burned it with fire,

Moses entreat the Lord in behalf of the children of Israel, and the Lord hearkened to the prayer of Moses, and the Lord was entreated of him in behalf of Israel.\n'),(28,82,'82',24,'24','Then spake the Lord to Moses to hew two stone tablets and to bring them up to the Lord, who would write upon them the ten commandments.\n'),(28,82,'82',25,'25','Now Moses did so, and he came down and hewed the two tablets and went up to Mount Sinai to the Lord, and the Lord wrote the ten commandments upon the tablets.\n'),(28,82,'82',26,'26','And Moses remained yet with the Lord forty days and forty nights,

offering.\n'),(28,83,'83',12,'12','And one kid of the goats for a sin offering.\n'),(28,83,'83',13,'13','And for a sacrifice of peace offering, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five lambs of a year old.\n'),(28,83,'83',14,'14','Thus did the twelve princes of Israel day by day, each man in his day.\n'),(28,83,'83',15,'15','And it was after this, in the thirteenth day of the month, that Moses commanded the children of Israel to observe the Passover.\n'),(28,83,'83',16,'16','And the children of Israel kept the Passover in its season in the fourteenth day of the month, as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.\n'),(28,83,'83',17,'17','And in the second month, on the first day thereof, the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,\n'),(28,83,'83',18,'18','Number the heads of all the males of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, thou and thy brother Aaron and the twelve princes of Israel.\n'),(28,83,'83',19,'19','And Moses did so, and Aaron came with the twelve princes of Israel, and they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.\n'),(28,83,'83',20,'20','And the numbers of the children of Israel by the houses of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.\n'),(28,83,'83',21,'21','But the children of Levi were not numbered amongst their brethren the children of Israel.\n'),(28,83,'83',22,'22','And the number of all the males of the children of Israel from one month old and upward, was twenty-two thousand, two hundred and seventy-three.\n'),(28,83,'83',23,'23','And the number of the children of Levi from one month old and above, was twenty-two thousand.\n'),(28,83,'83',24,'24','And Moses placed the priests and the Levites each man to his service and to his burden to serve the sanctuary of the tabernacle, as the Lord had commanded Moses.\n'),(28,83,'83',25,'25','And on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken away from the tabernacle of testimony.\n'),(28,83,'83',26,'26','At that time the children of Israel continued their journey from the wilderness of Sinai, and they took a journey of three days, and the cloud rested upon the wilderness of Paran; there the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, for they had provoked the Lord in asking him for meat, that they might eat.\n'),(28,83,'83',27,'27','And the Lord hearkened to their voice, and gave them meat which they ate for one month.\n'),(28,83,'83',28,'28','But after this the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he smote them with a great slaughter, and they were buried there in that place.\n'),(28,83,'83',29,'29','And the children of Israel called that place Kebroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted flesh.\n'),(28,83,'83',30,'30','And they departed from Kebroth Hattaavah and pitched in Hazeroth, which is in the wilderness of Paran.\n'),(28,83,'83',31,'31','And whilst the children of Israel were in Hazeroth, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Miriam on account of Moses, and she became leprous, white as snow.\n'),(28,83,'83',32,'32','And she was confined without the camp for seven days, until she had been received again after her leprosy.\n'),(28,83,'83',33,'33','The children of Israel afterward departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the end of the wilderness of Paran.\n'),(28,83,'83',34,'34','At that time, the Lord spoke to Moses to send twelve men from the children of Israel, one man to a tribe, to go and explore the land of Canaan.\n'),(28,83,'83',35,'35','And Moses sent the twelve men, and they came to the land of Canaan to search and examine it, and they explored the whole land from the wilderness of Sin to Rechob as thou comest to Chamoth.\n'),(28,83,'83',36,'36','And at the end of forty days they came to Moses and Aaron, and they brought him word as it was in their hearts, and ten of the men brought up an evil

inhabitants.\n'),(28,83,'83',37,'37','But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephuneh, who were of those that explored the land, said, The land is exceedingly good.\n'),(28,83,'83',38,'38','If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us to this land and give it to us, for it is a land flowing with milk and honey.\n'),(28,83,'83',39,'39','But the children

Lord.\n'),(28,83,'83',43,'43','And the people dwelt in the wilderness of Paran a long time, and they afterward proceeded to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.\n'),(28,84,'84',1,'1','At that time Korah the son of Jetzer the son of Kehath the son of Levi, took many men of the children of Israel, and they rose up and quarreled with Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation.\n'),(28,84,'84',2,'2','And the Lord was angry with them, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, with their houses and all belonging to them, and all the men belonging to Korah.\n'),(28,84,'84',3,'3','And after this God made the people go round by the way of Mount Seir for a long time.\n'),(28,84,'84',4,'4','At that time the Lord said unto Moses, Provoke not a war

built for himself in the land of Chittim, and Abimnas reigned in his place for thirty-eight years.\n'),(28,84,'84',11,'11','And the children of Israel passed the boundary of the children of Esau in those days, at the end of nineteen years, and they came and passed the road of the wilderness of Moab.\n'),(28,84,'84',12,'12','And the Lord said to Moses, besiege not Moab, and do not fight against them, for I will give you nothing of their land.\n'),(28,84,'84',13,'13','And the children of Israel passed the road of the wilderness of Moab for nineteen years, and they did not fight against them.\n'),(28,84,'84',14,'14','And in the thirty-sixth year of the children of Israel\'s departing from Egypt the Lord smote the heart of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and he waged war, and went forth

Moab in the battle; he also took Heshbon from them, for Heshbon was one of the cities of Moab, and Sihon placed his princes and his nobles in Heshbon, and Heshbon belonged to Sihon in those days.\n'),(28,84,'84',19,'19','Therefore the parable speakers Beor and Balaam his son uttered these words, saying, Come unto Heshbon, the city of Sihon will be built and

the place Hormah.\n'),(28,85,'85',9,'9','And the children of Israel journeyed from Mount Hor and pitched in Oboth, and they journeyed from Oboth and they pitched at Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab.\n'),(28,85,'85',10,'10','And the children of Israel sent to Moab, saying, Let us pass now through thy land into our place, but the children of Moab would not suffer the children of Israel to

slain many of them.\n'),(28,85,'85',11,'11','Therefore Moab would not suffer the Israelites to pass through his land, and the Lord commanded the children of Israel, saying, That they should not fight

the head of Og, and the stone fell upon the neck of Og that Og fell to the earth on account of the weight of the stone upon his neck.\n'),(28,85,'85',26,'26','At that time the Lord said to the children of Israel, Be not afraid of him, for I have given him and all his people and all his land into your hand, and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon.\n'),(28,85,'85',27,'27','And Moses went down to him with a small number of the children of Israel, and Moses smote Og with a stick at the ankles of his feet and slew him.\n'),(28,85,'85',28,'28','The children of Israel afterward pursued the children of Og and all his people, and they beat and destroyed them till there was no remnant left of them.\n'),(28,85,'85',29,'29','Moses afterward sent some of the children of Israel to spy out

Jaazer.\n'),(28,85,'85',31,'31','And these men took Jaazer and its villages, and the Lord delivered them into their hand, and they drove out the Amorites who had been there.\n'),(28,85,'85',32,'32','And the children of Israel took the land of the two kings of the Amorites, sixty cities which were on the other side of Jordan, from the brook of Arnon unto Mount Herman.\n'),(28,85,'85',33,'33','And the children of Israel journeyed and came into the plain of Moab which is on this side of Jordan, by Jericho.\n'),(28,85,'85',34,'34','And the children of Moab

the elders of Moab said, Behold the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were more powerful than all the kings of the earth, could not stand against the children of Israel, how then can we

Midian.\n'),(28,85,'85',51,'51','And the children of Israel journeyed from the plain of Moab, and pitched by Jordan from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim, at the end of the plains of Moab.\n'),(28,85,'85',52,'52','And when the children of Israel abode in the plain of Shittim, they began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.\n'),(28,85,'85',53,'53','And the children of Israel approached Moab, and the children of Moab pitched their tents opposite to the camp of the children of Israel.\n'),(28,85,'85',54,'54','And the children of Moab were afraid of the children of Israel, and the children of Moab took all their daughters and their wives of beautiful aspect and comely appearance, and dressed them in gold and silver and costly

meet them with joy.\n'),(28,86,'86',12,'12','And they divided all the spoil of Midian, and the children of Israel had been revenged upon Midian for the cause of their brethren the children of Israel.\n'),(28,87,'87',1,'1','At that time the Lord said to Moses, Behold thy days are approaching to an end, take now Joshua the son of Nun thy servant and place him in the tabernacle, and I will command him, and Moses did so.\n'),(28,87,'87',2,'2','And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tabernacle.\n'),(28,87,'87',3,'3','And the Lord commanded Joshua the son of Nun and said unto him, Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt bring the children of Israel to the land which I swore to give them, and I will be with thee.\n'),(28,87,'87',4,'4','And Moses said to Joshua, Be strong and courageous, for thou wilt make the children of Israel inherit the land, and the Lord will be with thee, he will not leave thee nor forsake thee, be not afraid nor disheartened.\n'),(28,87,'87',5,'5','And Moses called to all the children of Israel and said to them, You have seen all the good which the Lord your God has done for you in the wilderness.\n'),(28,87,'87',6,'6','Now therefore observe all the words of this law, and walk in the way of the Lord your God, turn not from the way which the Lord has commanded you, either to the right or to the left.\n'),(28,87,'87',7,'7','And Moses taught the children of Israel statutes and judgments and laws to do in the land as the Lord had commanded him.\n'),(28,87,'87',8,'8','And he taught them the way of the Lord and his laws; behold they are written upon the book of the law of God which he gave to the children of Israel by the hand of Moses.\n'),(28,87,'87',9,'9','And Moses finished commanding the children of Israel, and the Lord said to him, saying, Go up to the Mount Abarim and die there, and be gathered unto thy people as Aaron thy brother was gathered.\n'),(28,87,'87',10,'10','And Moses went up as the Lord had commanded him, and he died there in the land of Moab by the order of the Lord, in the fortieth year from the Israelites going forth from the land of Egypt.\n'),(28,87,'87',11,'11','And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days, and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.\n'),(28,88,'88',1,'1','And it was after the death of Moses that the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, saying,\n'),(28,88,'88',2,'2','Rise up and pass the Jordan to the land which I have given to the children of Israel, and thou shalt make the children of Israel inherit the land.\n'),(28,88,'88',3,'3','Every place upon which the sole of your feet shall tread shall belong to you, from the wilderness of Lebanon unto the great river the river of Perath shall be your boundary.\n'),(28,88,'88',4,'4','No man shall stand up against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee, only be strong and of good courage to observe all the law which Moses commanded thee, turn not from the way either to the right or to the left, in order that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest.\n'),(28,88,'88',5,'5','And Joshua commanded the officers of Israel, saying, Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provisions, for in three days more you will pass the Jordan to possess the land.\n'),(28,88,'88',6,'6','And the officers of the children of Israel did so, and they commanded the people and they did all that Joshua had commanded.\n'),(28,88,'88',7,'7','And Joshua sent two men to spy out the land of Jericho, and the men went and spied out Jericho.\n'),(28,88,'88',8,'8','And at the end of seven days they came to Joshua in the camp and said to him, The Lord has delivered the whole land into our hand, and the inhabitants thereof are melted with fear because of us.\n'),(28,88,'88',9,'9','And it came to pass after that, that Joshua rose up in the morning and all Israel with him, and they journeyed from Shittim, and Joshua and all Israel with him passed the Jordan; and Joshua was eighty-two years old when he passed the Jordan with Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',10,'10','And the people went up from Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped in Gilgal at the eastern corner of Jericho.\n'),(28,88,'88',11,'11','And the children of Israel kept the Passover in Gilgal, in the plains of Jericho, on the fourteenth day at the month, as it is written in the law of Moses.\n'),(28,88,'88',12,'12','And the manna ceased at that time on the morrow of the Passover, and there was no more manna for the children of Israel, and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan.\n'),(28,88,'88',13,'13','And Jericho was entirely closed against the children of Israel, no one came out or went in.\n'),(28,88,'88',14,'14','And it was in the second month, on the first day of the month, that the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up, behold I have given Jericho into thy hand with all the people thereof; and all your fighting men shall go round the city, once each day, thus shall you do for six days.\n'),(28,88,'88',15,'15','And the priests shall blow upon trumpets, and when you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall give a great shouting, that the walls of the city shall fall down; all the people shall go up every man against his opponent.\n'),(28,88,'88',16,'16','And Joshua did so according to all that the Lord had commanded him.\n'),(28,88,'88',17,'17','And on the seventh day they went round the city seven times, and the priests blew upon trumpets.\n'),(28,88,'88',18,'18','And at the seventh round, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for the Lord has delivered the whole city into our hands.\n'),(28,88,'88',19,'19','Only the city and all that it contains shall be accursed to the Lord, and keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it.\n'),(28,88,'88',20,'20','But all the silver and gold and brass and iron shall be consecrated to the Lord, they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.\n'),(28,88,'88',21,'21','And the people blew upon trumpets and made a great shouting, and the walls of Jericho fell down, and all the people went up, every man straight before him, and they took the city and utterly destroyed all that was in it, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.\n'),(28,88,'88',22,'22','And they burned the whole city with fire; only the vessels of silver and gold, and brass and iron, they put into the treasury of the Lord.\n'),(28,88,'88',23,'23','And Joshua swore at that time, saying, Cursed be the man who builds Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates thereof.\n'),(28,88,'88',24,'24','And Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, son of Judah, dealt treacherously in the accursed thing, and he took of the accursed thing and hid it in the tent, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',25,'25','And it was after this when the children of Israel had returned from burning Jericho, Joshua sent men to spy out also Ai, and to fight against it.\n'),(28,88,'88',26,'26','And the men went up and spied out Ai, and they returned and said, Let not all the people go up with thee to Ai, only let about three thousand men go up and smite the city, for the men thereof are but few.\n'),(28,88,'88',27,'27','And Joshua did so, and there went up with him of the children of Israel about three thousand men, and they fought against the men of Ai.\n'),(28,88,'88',28,'28','And the battle was severe against Israel, and the men of Ai smote thirty-six men of Israel, and the children of Israel fled from before the men of Ai.\n'),(28,88,'88',29,'29','And when Joshua saw this thing, he tore his garments and fell upon his face to the ground before the Lord, he, with the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their heads.\n'),(28,88,'88',30,'30','And Joshua said, Why O Lord didst thou bring this people over the Jordan? what shall I say after the Israelites have turned their backs against their enemies?\n'),(28,88,'88',31,'31','Now therefore all the Canaanites, inhabitants of the land, will hear this thing, and surround us and cut off our name.\n'),(28,88,'88',32,'32','And the Lord said to Joshua, Why dost thou fall upon thy face? rise, get thee off, for the Israelites have sinned, and taken of the accursed thing; I will no more be with them unless they destroy the accursed thing from amongst them.\n'),(28,88,'88',33,'33','And Joshua rose up and assembled the people, and brought the Urim by the order of the Lord, and the tribe of Judah was taken, and Achan the son of Carmi was taken.\n'),(28,88,'88',34,'34','And Joshua said to Achan, Tell me my son, what hast thou done, and Achan said, I saw amongst the spoil a goodly garment of Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight; I coveted them and took them, and behold they are all hid in the earth in the midst of the tent.\n'),(28,88,'88',35,'35','And Joshua sent men who went and took them from the tent of Achan, and they brought them to Joshua.\n'),(28,88,'88',36,'36','And Joshua took Achan and these utensils, and his sons and daughters and all belonging to him, and they brought them into the valley of Achor.\n'),(28,88,'88',37,'37','And Joshua burned them there with fire, and all the Israelites stoned Achan with stones, and they raised over him a heap of stones, therefore did he call that place the valley of Achor, so the Lord\'s anger was appeased, and Joshua afterward came to the city and fought against it.\n'),(28,88,'88',38,'38','And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed, behold I have given into thy hand Ai, her king and her people, and thou shalt do unto them as thou didst to Jericho and her king, only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall you take for a prey for yourselves; lay an ambush for the city behind it.\n'),(28,88,'88',39,'39','So Joshua did according to the word of the Lord, and he chose from amongst the sons of war thirty thousand valiant men, and he sent them, and they lay in ambush for the city.\n'),(28,88,'88',40,'40','And he commanded them, saying, When you shall see us we will flee before them with cunning, and they will pursue us, you shall then rise out of the ambush and take the city, and they did so.\n'),(28,88,'88',41,'41','And Joshua fought, and the men of the city went out toward Israel, not knowing that they were lying in ambush for them behind the city.\n'),(28,88,'88',42,'42','And Joshua and all the Israelites feigned themselves wearied out before them, and they fled by the way of the wilderness with cunning.\n'),(28,88,'88',43,'43','And the men of Ai gathered all the people who were in the city to pursue the Israelites, and they went out and were drawn away from the city, not one remained, and they left the city open and pursued the Israelites.\n'),(28,88,'88',44,'44','And those who were lying in ambush rose up out of their places, and hastened to come to the city and took it and set it on fire, and the men of Ai turned back, and behold the smoke of the city ascended to the skies, and they had no means of retreating either one way or the other.\n'),(28,88,'88',45,'45','And all the men of Ai were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side, and they smote them so that not one of them remained.\n'),(28,88,'88',46,'46','And the children of Israel took Melosh king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua, and Joshua hanged him on a tree and he died.\n'),(28,88,'88',47,'47','And the children of Israel returned to the city after having burned it, and they smote all those that were in it with the edge of the sword.\n'),(28,88,'88',48,'48','And the number of those that had fallen of the men of Ai, both man and woman, was twelve thousand; only the cattle and the spoil of the city they took to themselves, according to the word of the Lord to Joshua.\n'),(28,88,'88',49,'49','And all the kings on this side Jordan, all the kings of Canaan, heard of the evil which the children of Israel had done to Jericho and to Ai, and they gathered themselves together to fight against Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',50,'50','Only the inhabitants of Gibeon were greatly afraid of fighting against the Israelites lest they should perish, so they acted cunningly, and they came to Joshua and to all Israel, and said unto them, We have come from a distant land, now therefore make a covenant with us.\n'),(28,88,'88',51,'51','And the inhabitants of Gibeon over-reached the children of Israel, and the children of Israel made a covenant with them, and they made peace with them, and the princes of the congregation swore unto them, but afterward the children of Israel knew that they were neighbors to them and were dwelling amongst them.\n'),(28,88,'88',52,'52','But the children of Israel slew them not; for they had sworn to them by the Lord, and they became hewers of wood and drawers of water.\n'),(28,88,'88',53,'53','And Joshua said to them, Why did you deceive me, to do this thing to us? and they answered him, saying, Because it was told to thy servants all that you had done to all the kings of the Amorites, and we were greatly afraid of our lives, and we did this thing.\n'),(28,88,'88',54,'54','And Joshua appointed them on that day to hew wood and to draw water, and he divided them for slaves to all the tribes of Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',55,'55','And when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem heard all that the children of Israel had done to Jericho and to Ai, he sent to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king at Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Deber king of Eglon, saying,\n'),(28,88,'88',56,'56','Come up to me and help me, that we may smite the children of Israel and the inhabitants of Gibeon who have made peace with the children of Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',57,'57','And they gathered themselves together and the five kings of the Amorites went up with all their camps, a mighty people numerous as the sand of the sea shore.\n'),(28,88,'88',58,'58','And all these kings came and encamped before Gibeon, and they began to fight against the inhabitants of Gibeon, and all the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, saying, Come up quickly to us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites have gathered together to fight against us.\n'),(28,88,'88',59,'59','And Joshua and all the fighting people went up from Gilgal, and Joshua came suddenly to them, and smote these five kings with a great slaughter.\n'),(28,88,'88',60,'60','And the Lord confounded them before the children at Israel, who smote them with a terrible slaughter in Gibeon, and pursued them along the way that goes up to Beth Horon unto Makkedah, and they fled from before the children of Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',61,'61','And whilst they were fleeing, the Lord sent upon them hailstones from heaven, and more of them died by the hailstones, than by the slaughter of the children of Israel.\n'),(28,88,'88',62,'62','And the children of Israel pursued them, and they still smote them in the road, going on and smiting them.\n'),(28,88,'88',63,'63','And when they were smiting, the day was declining toward evening, and Joshua said in the sight of all the people, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon, until the nation shall have revenged itself upon its enemies.\n'),(28,88,'88',64,'64','And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Joshua, and the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and it stood still six and thirty moments, and the moon also stood still and hastened not to go down a whole day.\n'),(28,88,'88',65,'65','And there was no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.\n'),(28,89,'89',1,'1','Then spoke Joshua this song, on the day that the Lord had given the Amorites into the hand of Joshua and the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of all Israel,\n'),(28,89,'89',2,'2','Thou hast done mighty things, O Lord, thou hast performed great deeds; who is like unto thee? my lips shall sing to thy name.\n'),(28,89,'89',3,'3','My goodness and my fortress, my high tower, I will sing a new song unto thee, with thanksgiving will I sing to thee, thou art the strength of my salvation.\n'),(28,89,'89',4,'4','All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, the princes of the world shall sing to thee, the children of Israel shall rejoice in thy salvation, they shall sing and praise thy power.\n'),(28,89,'89',5,'5','To thee, O Lord, did we confide; we said thou art our God, for thou wast our shelter and strong tower against our enemies.\n'),(28,89,'89',6,'6','To thee we cried and were not ashamed, in thee we trusted and were delivered; when we cried unto thee, thou didst hear our voice, thou didst deliver our souls from the sword, thou didst show unto us thy grace, thou didst give unto us thy salvation, thou didst rejoice our hearts with thy strength.\n'),(28,89,'89',7,'7','Thou didst go forth for our salvation, with thine arm thou didst redeem thy people; thou didst answer us from the heavens of thy holiness, thou didst save us from ten thousands of people.\n'),(28,89,'89',8,'8','The sun and moon stood still in heaven, and thou didst stand in thy wrath against our oppressors and didst command thy judgments over them.\n'),(28,89,'89',9,'9','All the princes of the earth stood up, the kings of the nations had gathered themselves together, they were not moved at thy presence, they desired thy battles.\n'),(28,89,'89',10,'10','Thou didst rise against them in thine anger, and didst bring down thy wrath upon them; thou didst destroy them in thine anger, and cut them off in thine heart.\n'),(28,89,'89',11,'11','Nations have been consumed with thy fury, kingdoms have declined because of thy wrath, thou didst wound kings in the day of thine anger.\n'),(28,89,'89',12,'12','Thou didst pour out thy fury upon them, thy wrathful anger took hold of them; thou didst turn their iniquity upon them, and didst cut them off in their wickedness.\n'),(28,89,'89',13,'13','They did spread a trap, they fell therein, in the net they hid, their foot was caught.\n'),(28,89,'89',14,'14','Thine hand was ready for all thine enemies who said, Through their sword they possessed the land, through their arm they dwelt in the city; thou didst fill their faces with shame, thou didst bring their horns down to the ground, thou didst terrify them in thy wrath, and didst destroy them in thine anger.\n'),(28,89,'89',15,'15','The earth trembled and shook at the sound of thy storm over them, thou didst not withhold their souls from death, and didst bring down their lives to the grave.\n'),(28,89,'89',16,'16','Thou didst pursue them in thy storm, thou didst consume them in thy whirlwind, thou didst turn their rain into hail, they fell in deep pits so that they could not rise.\n'),(28,89,'89',17,'17','Their carcasses were like rubbish cast out in the middle of the streets.\n'),(28,89,'89',18,'18','They were consumed and destroyed in thine anger, thou didst save thy people with thy might.\n'),(28,89,'89',19,'19','Therefore our hearts rejoice in thee, our souls exalt in thy salvation.\n'),(28,89,'89',20,'20','Our tongues shall relate thy might, we will sing and praise thy wondrous works.\n'),(28,89,'89',21,'21','For thou didst save us from our enemies, thou didst deliver us from those who rose up against us, thou didst destroy them from before us and depress them beneath our feet.\n'),(28,89,'89',22,'22','Thus shall all thine enemies perish O Lord, and the wicked shall be like chaff driven by the wind, and thy beloved shall be like trees planted by the waters.\n'),(28,89,'89',23,'23','So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp in Gilgal, after having smitten all the kings, so that not a remnant was left of them.\n'),(28,89,'89',24,'24','And the five kings fled alone on foot from battle, and hid themselves in a cave, and Joshua sought for them in the field of battle, and did not find them.\n'),(28,89,'89',25,'25','And it was afterward told to Joshua, saying, The kings are found and behold they are hidden in a cave.\n'),(28,89,'89',26,'26','And Joshua said, Appoint men to be at the mouth of the cave, to guard them, lest they take themselves away; and the children of Israel did so.\n'),(28,89,'89',27,'27','And Joshua called to all Israel and said to the officers of battle, Place your feet upon the necks of these kings, and Joshua said, So shall the Lord do to all your enemies.\n'),(28,89,'89',28,'28','And Joshua commanded afterward that they should slay the kings and cast them into the cave, and to put great stones at the mouth of the cave.\n'),(28,89,'89',29,'29','And Joshua went afterward with all the people that were with him on that day to Makkedah, and he smote it with the edge of the sword.\n'),(28,89,'89',30,'30','And he utterly destroyed the souls and all belonging to the city, and he did to the king and people thereof as he had done to Jericho.\n'),(28,89,'89',31,'31','And he passed from there to Libnah and he fought against it, and the Lord delivered it into his hand, and Joshua smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls thereof, and he did to it and to the king thereof as he had done to Jericho.\n'),(28,89,'89',32,'32','And from there he passed on to Lachish to fight against it, and Horam king of Gaza went up to assist the men of Lachish, and Joshua smote him and his people until there was none left to him.\n'),(28,89,'89',33,'33','And Joshua took Lachish and all the people thereof, and he did to it as he had done to Libnah.\n'),(28,89,'89',34,'34','And Joshua passed from there to Eglon, and he took that also, and he smote it and all the people thereof with the edge of the sword.\n'),(28,89,'89',35,'35','And from there he passed to Hebron and fought against it and took it and utterly destroyed it, and he returned from there with all Israel to Debir and fought against it

their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them:\n'),(29,8,'8',13,'13','Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted:\n'),(29,8,'8',14,'14','Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby:\n'),(29,8,'8',15,'15','Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:\n'),(29,8,'8',16,'16','And that they committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them.\n'),(29,8,'8',17,'17','In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,\n'),(29,8,'8',18,'18','And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israel with servitude.\n'),(29,8,'8',19,'19','They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they spake and said.\n'),(29,8,'8',20,'20','Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.\n'),(29,8,'8',21,'21','So that matter pleased the Romans well.\n'),(29,8,'8',22,'22','And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:\n'),(29,8,'8',23,'23','Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be far from them,\n'),(29,8,'8',24,'24','If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their dominion,\n'),(29,8,'8',25,'25','The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart:\n'),(29,8,'8',26,'26','Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without taking any thing therefore.\n'),(29,8,'8',27,'27','In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them:\n'),(29,8,'8',28,'28','Neither shall victuals be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that without deceit.\n'),(29,8,'8',29,'29','According to these articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews.\n'),(29,8,'8',30,'30','Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified.\n'),(29,8,'8',31,'31','And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews?\n'),(29,8,'8',32,'32','If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.\n'),(29,9,'9',1,'1','Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host:\n'),(29,9,'9',2,'2','Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people.\n'),(29,9,'9',3,'3','Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem:\n'),(29,9,'9',4,'4','From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen.\n'),(29,9,'9',5,'5','Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:\n'),(29,9,'9',6,'6','Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men.\n'),(29,9,'9',7,'7','When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to gather them together.\n'),(29,9,'9',8,'8','Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight with them.\n'),(29,9,'9',9,'9','But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.\n'),(29,9,'9',10,'10','Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our honour.\n'),(29,9,'9',11,'11','With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men.\n'),(29,9,'9',12,'12','As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.\n'),(29,9,'9',13,'13','They also of Judas’ side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night.\n'),(29,9,'9',14,'14','Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardy men,\n'),(29,9,'9',15,'15','Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus.\n'),(29,9,'9',16,'16','But when they of the left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind:\n'),(29,9,'9',17,'17','Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts.\n'),(29,9,'9',18,'18','Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled.\n'),(29,9,'9',19,'19','THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.\n'),(29,9,'9',20,'20','Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying,\n'),(29,9,'9',21,'21','How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel!\n'),(29,9,'9',22,'22','As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many.\n'),(29,9,'9',23,'23','Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity.\n'),(29,9,'9',24,'24','In those days also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and went with them.\n'),(29,9,'9',25,'25','Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords of the country.\n'),(29,9,'9',26,'26','And they made enquiry and search for Judas’ friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used them despitefully.\n'),(29,9,'9',27,'27','So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.\n'),(29,9,'9',28,'28','For this cause all Judas’ friends came together, and said unto Jonathan,\n'),(29,9,'9',29,'29','Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us.\n'),(29,9,'9',30,'30','Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles.\n'),(29,9,'9',31,'31','Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his brother Judas.\n'),(29,9,'9',32,'32','But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him\n'),(29,9,'9',33,'33','Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar.\n'),(29,9,'9',34,'34','Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day.\n'),(29,9,'9',35,'35','Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much.\n'),(29,9,'9',36,'36','But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it.\n'),(29,9,'9',37,'37','After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan.\n'),(29,9,'9',38,'38','Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:\n'),(29,9,'9',39,'39','Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons.\n'),(29,9,'9',40,'40','Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.\n'),(29,9,'9',41,'41','Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation.\n'),(29,9,'9',42,'42','So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh of Jordan.\n'),(29,9,'9',43,'43','Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a great power.\n'),(29,9,'9',44,'44','Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past:\n'),(29,9,'9',45,'45','For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside.\n'),(29,9,'9',46,'46','Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies.\n'),(29,9,'9',47,'47','With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.\n'),(29,9,'9',48,'48','Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them.\n'),(29,9,'9',49,'49','So there were slain of Bacchides’ side that day about a thousand men.\n'),(29,9,'9',50,'50','Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars.\n'),(29,9,'9',51,'51','And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel.\n'),(29,9,'9',52,'52','He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.\n'),(29,9,'9',53,'53','Besides, he took the chief men’s sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.\n'),(29,9,'9',54,'54','Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of the prophets\n'),(29,9,'9',55,'55','And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.\n'),(29,9,'9',56,'56','So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.\n'),(29,9,'9',57,'57','Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.\n'),(29,9,'9',58,'58','Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night.\n'),(29,9,'9',59,'59','So they went and consulted with him.\n'),(29,9,'9',60,'60','Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them.\n'),(29,9,'9',61,'61','Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.\n'),(29,9,'9',62,'62','Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.\n'),(29,9,'9',63,'63','Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Judea.\n'),(29,9,'9',64,'64','Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made engines of war.\n'),(29,9,'9',65,'65','But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth himself into the country, and with a certain number went he forth.\n'),(29,9,'9',66,'66','And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.\n'),(29,9,'9',67,'67','And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the engines of war,\n'),(29,9,'9',68,'68','And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in vain.\n'),(29,9,'9',69,'69','Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave him counsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to return into his own country.\n'),(29,9,'9',70,'70','Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them the prisoners.\n'),(29,9,'9',71,'71','Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands, and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the days of his life.\n'),(29,9,'9',72,'72','When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and went his way into his own land, neither came he any more into their borders.\n'),(29,9,'9',73,'73','Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of Israel.\n'),(29,10,'10',1,'1','In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: for the people had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,\n'),(29,10,'10',2,'2','Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together an exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.\n'),(29,10,'10',3,'3','Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with loving words, so as he magnified him.\n'),(29,10,'10',4,'4','For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he join with Alexander against us:\n'),(29,10,'10',5,'5','Else he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brethren and his people.\n'),(29,10,'10',6,'6','Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host, and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: he commanded also that the hostages that were in the tower should be delivered him.\n'),(29,10,'10',7,'7','Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:\n'),(29,10,'10',8,'8','Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an host.\n'),(29,10,'10',9,'9','Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages unto Jonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.\n'),(29,10,'10',10,'10','This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and began to build and repair the city.\n'),(29,10,'10',11,'11','And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and the mount Sion and about with square stones for fortification; and they did so.\n'),(29,10,'10',12,'12','Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses which Bacchides had built, fled away;\n'),(29,10,'10',13,'13','Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his own country.\n'),(29,10,'10',14,'14','Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments remained still: for it was their place of refuge.\n'),(29,10,'10',15,'15','Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had sent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles and noble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the pains that they had endured,\n'),(29,10,'10',16,'16','He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore we will make him our friend and confederate.\n'),(29,10,'10',17,'17','Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, according to these words, saying,\n'),(29,10,'10',18,'18','King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:\n'),(29,10,'10',19,'19','We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and meet to be our friend.\n'),(29,10,'10',20,'20','Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priest of thy nation, and to be called the king’s friend; (and therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and require thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.\n'),(29,10,'10',21,'21','So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, and gathered together forces, and provided much armour.\n'),(29,10,'10',22,'22','Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,\n'),(29,10,'10',23,'23','What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in making amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?\n'),(29,10,'10',24,'24','I also will write unto them words of encouragement, and promise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.\n'),(29,10,'10',25,'25','He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetrius unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:\n'),(29,10,'10',26,'26','Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.\n'),(29,10,'10',27,'27','Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, and we will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,\n'),(29,10,'10',28,'28','And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.\n'),(29,10,'10',29,'29','And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all the Jews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from crown taxes,\n'),(29,10,'10',30,'30','And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for the third part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees, I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not be taken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments which are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth for evermore.\n'),(29,10,'10',31,'31','Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the borders thereof, both from tenths and tributes.\n'),(29,10,'10',32,'32','And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield up authority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.\n'),(29,10,'10',33,'33','Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, that were carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part of my kingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes even of their cattle.\n'),(29,10,'10',34,'34','Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, and the three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and freedom for all the Jews in my realm.\n'),(29,10,'10',35,'35','Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molest any of them in any matter.\n'),(29,10,'10',36,'36','I will further, that there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay shall be given, as belongeth to all king’s forces.\n'),(29,10,'10',37,'37','And of them some shall be placed in the king’s strong holds, of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and I will that their overseers and governors be of themselves, and that they live after their own laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.\n'),(29,10,'10',38,'38','And concerning the three governments that are added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey other authority than the high priest’s.\n'),(29,10,'10',39,'39','As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give it as a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessary expences of the sanctuary.\n'),(29,10,'10',40,'40','Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver out of the king’s accounts from the places appertaining.\n'),(29,10,'10',41,'41','And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as in former time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works of the temple.\n'),(29,10,'10',42,'42','And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which they took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts year by year, even those things shall be released, because they appertain to the priests that minister.\n'),(29,10,'10',43,'43','And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem, or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto the king, or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all that they have in my realm.\n'),(29,10,'10',44,'44','For the building also and repairing of the works of the sanctuary expences shall be given of the king’s accounts.\n'),(29,10,'10',45,'45','Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out of the king’s accounts, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.\n'),(29,10,'10',46,'46','Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credit unto them, nor received them, because they remembered the great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflicted them very sore.\n'),(29,10,'10',47,'47','But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was the first that entreated of true peace with them, and they were confederate with him always.\n'),(29,10,'10',48,'48','Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped over against Demetrius.\n'),(29,10,'10',49,'49','And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius’ host fled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed against them.\n'),(29,10,'10',50,'50','And he continued the battle very sore until the sun went down: and that day was Demetrius slain.\n'),(29,10,'10',51,'51','Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt with a message to this effect:\n'),(29,10,'10',52,'52','Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in the throne of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, and overthrown Demetrius, and recovered our country;\n'),(29,10,'10',53,'53','For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his host was discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of his kingdom:\n'),(29,10,'10',54,'54','Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, and give me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law, and will give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.\n'),(29,10,'10',55,'55','Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the day wherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, and satest in the throne of their kingdom.\n'),(29,10,'10',56,'56','And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet me therefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I will marry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.\n'),(29,10,'10',57,'57','So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and second year:\n'),(29,10,'10',58,'58','Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, as the manner of kings is.\n'),(29,10,'10',59,'59','Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he should come and meet him.\n'),(29,10,'10',60,'60','Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the two kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, and many presents, and found favour in their sight.\n'),(29,10,'10',61,'61','At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: but the king would not hear them.\n'),(29,10,'10',62,'62','Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off his garments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.\n'),(29,10,'10',63,'63','And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Go with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.\n'),(29,10,'10',64,'64','Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according to the proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.\n'),(29,10,'10',65,'65','So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chief friends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.\n'),(29,10,'10',66,'66','Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.\n'),(29,10,'10',67,'67','Furthermore in the; hundred threescore and fifth year came Demetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his fathers:\n'),(29,10,'10',68,'68','Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry, and returned into Antioch.\n'),(29,10,'10',69,'69','Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria his general, who gathered together a great host, and camped in Jamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,\n'),(29,10,'10',70,'70','Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughed to scorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thy power against us in the mountains?\n'),(29,10,'10',71,'71','Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let us try the matter together: for with me is the power of the cities.\n'),(29,10,'10',72,'72','Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, and they shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight in their own land.\n'),(29,10,'10',73,'73','Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemen and so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee unto.\n'),(29,10,'10',74,'74','So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out of Jerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.\n'),(29,10,'10',75,'75','And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppa shut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrison there.\n'),(29,10,'10',76,'76','Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the city let him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.\n'),(29,10,'10',77,'77','Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousand horsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus as one that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the plain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.\n'),(29,10,'10',78,'78','Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armies joined battle.\n'),(29,10,'10',79,'79','Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.\n'),(29,10,'10',80,'80','And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him; for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the people, from morning till evening.\n'),(29,10,'10',81,'81','But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so the enemies’ horses were tired.\n'),(29,10,'10',82,'82','Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled.\n'),(29,10,'10',83,'83','The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol’s temple, for safety.\n'),(29,10,'10',84,'84','But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.\n'),(29,10,'10',85,'85','Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigh eight thousand men.\n'),(29,10,'10',86,'86','And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with great pomp.\n'),(29,10,'10',87,'87','After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem, having any spoils.\n'),(29,10,'10',88,'88','Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more.\n'),(29,10,'10',89,'89','And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the king’s blood: he gave him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession.\n'),(29,11,'11',1,'1','And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander’s kingdom, and join it to his own.\n'),(29,11,'11',2,'2','Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner, so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother in law.\n'),(29,11,'11',3,'3','Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.\n'),(29,11,'11',4,'4','And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass.\n'),(29,11,'11',5,'5','Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.\n'),(29,11,'11',6,'6','Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.\n'),(29,11,'11',7,'7','Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.\n'),(29,11,'11',8,'8','King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.\n'),(29,11,'11',9,'9','Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy father’s kingdom:\n'),(29,11,'11',10,'10','For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he sought to slay me.\n'),(29,11,'11',11,'11','Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdom.\n'),(29,11,'11',12,'12','Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known.\n'),(29,11,'11',13,'13','Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.\n'),(29,11,'11',14,'14','In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.\n'),(29,11,'11',15,'15','But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight.\n'),(29,11,'11',16,'16','So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted:\n'),(29,11,'11',17,'17','For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it unto Ptolemee.\n'),(29,11,'11',18,'18','King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were slain one of another.\n'),(29,11,'11',19,'19','By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.\n'),(29,11,'11',20,'20','At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.\n'),(29,11,'11',21,'21','Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,\n'),(29,11,'11',22,'22','Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.\n'),(29,11,'11',23,'23','Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;\n'),(29,11,'11',24,'24','And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favour in his sight.\n'),(29,11,'11',25,'25','And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,\n'),(29,11,'11',26,'26','Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,\n'),(29,11,'11',27,'27','And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends.\n'),(29,11,'11',28,'28','Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.\n'),(29,11,'11',29,'29','So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this manner:\n'),(29,11,'11',30,'30','King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:\n'),(29,11,'11',31,'31','We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.\n'),(29,11,'11',32,'32','King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:\n'),(29,11,'11',33,'33','We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us.\n'),(29,11,'11',34,'34','Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.\n'),(29,11,'11',35,'35','And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.\n'),(29,11,'11',36,'36','And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for ever.\n'),(29,11,'11',37,'37','Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.\n'),(29,11,'11',38,'38','After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.\n'),(29,11,'11',39,'39','Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander’s part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,\n'),(29,11,'11',40,'40','And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father’s stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.\n'),(29,11,'11',41,'41','In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.\n'),(29,11,'11',42,'42','So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve.\n'),(29,11,'11',43,'43','Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me.\n'),(29,11,'11',44,'44','Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming.\n'),(29,11,'11',45,'45','Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.\n'),(29,11,'11',46,'46','Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.\n'),(29,11,'11',47,'47','Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.\n'),(29,11,'11',48,'48','Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day, and delivered the king.\n'),(29,11,'11',49,'49','So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,\n'),(29,11,'11',50,'50','Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.\n'),(29,11,'11',51,'51','With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.\n'),(29,11,'11',52,'52','So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.\n'),(29,11,'11',53,'53','Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.\n'),(29,11,'11',54,'54','After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.\n'),(29,11,'11',55,'55','Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.\n'),(29,11,'11',56,'56','Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.\n'),(29,11,'11',57,'57','At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s friends.\n'),(29,11,'11',58,'58','Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.\n'),(29,11,'11',59,'59','His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.\n'),(29,11,'11',60,'60','Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably.\n'),(29,11,'11',61,'61','From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.\n'),(29,11,'11',62,'62','Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country unto Damascus.\n'),(29,11,'11',63,'63','Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,\n'),(29,11,'11',64,'64','He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country.\n'),(29,11,'11',65,'65','Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:\n'),(29,11,'11',66,'66','But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.\n'),(29,11,'11',67,'67','As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to the plain of Nasor.\n'),(29,11,'11',68,'68','And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him.\n'),(29,11,'11',69,'69','So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan’s side fled;\n'),(29,11,'11',70,'70','Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of the host.\n'),(29,11,'11',71,'71','Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.\n'),(29,11,'11',72,'72','Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.\n'),(29,11,'11',73,'73','Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.\n'),(29,11,'11',74,'74','So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.\n'),(29,12,'12',1,'1','Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.\n'),(29,12,'12',2,'2','He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.\n'),(29,12,'12',3,'3','So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent us unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye had with them, and league, as in former time.\n'),(29,12,'12',4,'4','Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors of every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea peaceably.\n'),(29,12,'12',5,'5','And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:\n'),(29,12,'12',6,'6','Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting:\n'),(29,12,'12',7,'7','There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that ye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.\n'),(29,12,'12',8,'8','At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent honourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.\n'),(29,12,'12',9,'9','Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,\n'),(29,12,'12',10,'10','Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers unto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye sent unto us.\n'),(29,12,'12',11,'11','We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becometh us to think upon our brethren:\n'),(29,12,'12',12,'12','And we are right glad of your honour.\n'),(29,12,'12',13,'13','As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have fought against us.\n'),(29,12,'12',14,'14','Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in these wars:\n'),(29,12,'12',15,'15','For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot.\n'),(29,12,'12',16,'16','For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.\n'),(29,12,'12',17,'17','We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.\n'),(29,12,'12',18,'18','Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.\n'),(29,12,'12',19,'19','And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.\n'),(29,12,'12',20,'20','Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting:\n'),(29,12,'12',21,'21','It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:\n'),(29,12,'12',22,'22','Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your prosperity.\n'),(29,12,'12',23,'23','We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are our’s, and our’s are your’s We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report unto you on this wise.\n'),(29,12,'12',24,'24','Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius’ princes were come to fight against him with a greater host than afore,\n'),(29,12,'12',25,'25','He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.\n'),(29,12,'12',26,'26','He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season.\n'),(29,12,'12',27,'27','Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round about the host.\n'),(29,12,'12',28,'28','But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp.\n'),(29,12,'12',29,'29','Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.\n'),(29,12,'12',30,'30','Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.\n'),(29,12,'12',31,'31','Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.\n'),(29,12,'12',32,'32','And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country,\n'),(29,12,'12',33,'33','Simon also went forth, and passed through the country unto Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it.\n'),(29,12,'12',34,'34','For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto them that took Demetrius’ part; wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it.\n'),(29,12,'12',35,'35','After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea,\n'),(29,12,'12',36,'36','And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it.\n'),(29,12,'12',37,'37','Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.\n'),(29,12,'12',38,'38','Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars.\n'),(29,12,'12',39,'39','Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head.\n'),(29,12,'12',40,'40','Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him.

And he bade Ornias come with his destiny, and gave him the seal, saying: \"Away with thee, and bring me hither the prince of all the demons.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',13,'13','So Ornias took the finger-ring, and went off to Beelzeboul, who has kingship over the demons. He said to him: \"Hither! Solomon calls thee.\" But Beelzeboul, having heard, said to him: \"Tell me, who is this Solomon of whom thou speakest to me?\" Then Ornias threw the ring at the chest of Beelzeboul, saying: \"Solomon the king calls thee.\" But Beelzeboul cried aloud with a mighty voice, and shot out a great burning flame of fire; and he arose, and followed Ornias, and came to Solomon.\n'),(42,1,'1',14,'14','And when I saw the prince of demons, I glorified the Lord God, Maker of heaven and earth, and I said: \"Blessed art thou, Lord God Almighty, who hast given to Solomon thy servant wisdom, the assessor of the wise, and hast subjected unto me all the power of the devil.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',15,'15','And I questioned him, and said: \"Who art thou?\" The demon replied: \"I am Beelzebub, the exarch of the demons. And all the demons have their chief seats close to me. And I it is who make manifest the apparition of each demon.\" And he promised to bring to me in bonds all the unclean spirits. And I again glorified the God of heaven and earth, as I do always give thanks to him.\n'),(42,1,'1',16,'16','I then asked of the demon if there were females among them. And when he told me that there were, I said that I desired to see them. So Beelzeboul went off at high speed, and brought unto me Onoskelis, that had a very pretty shape, and the skin of a fair-hued woman; and she tossed her head.\n'),(42,1,'1',17,'17','And when she was come, I said to her: \"Tell me who art thou?\'\' But she said to me: \"I am called Onoskelis, a spirit wrought ...[?shabtai/Saturn?], lurking upon the earth. There is a golden cave where I lie. But I have a place that ever shifts. At one time I strangle men with a noose; at another, I creep up from the nature to the arms [in marg: \"worms\"]. But my most frequent dwelling-places are the precipices, caves, ravines. Oftentimes, however, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, and above all with those of a dark skin. For they share my star with me; since they it is who privily or openly worship my star, without knowing that they harm themselves, and but whet my appetite for further mischief. For they wish to provide money by means of memory (commemoration?), but I supply a little to those who worship me fairly.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',18,'18','And I Solomon questioned her about her birth, and she replied: \"I was born of a voice untimely, the so-called echo of a man\'s ordure dropped in a wood.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',19,'19','And I said to her: \"Under what star dost thou pass?\" And she answered me: \"Under the star of the full moon, for the reason that the moon travels over most things.\" Then I said to her: \"And what angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And she said to me: \"He that in thee [or \"through thee\"] is reigning.\" And I thought that she mocked me, and bade a soldier strike her. But she cried aloud, and said: \"I am [subjected] to thee, O king, by the wisdom of God given to thee, and by the angel Joel.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',20,'20','So I commanded her to spin the hemp for the ropes used in the building of the house of God; and accordingly, when I had sealed and bound her, she was so overcome and brought to naught as to stand night and day spinning the hemp.\n'),(42,1,'1',21,'21','And I at once bade another demon to be led unto me; and instantly there approached me the demon Asmodeus, bound, and I asked him: \"Who art thou ?\'\' But he shot on me a glance of anger and rage, and said: \"And who art thou?\'\' And I said to him: \"Thus punished as thou art, answerest thou me?\" But he, with rage, said to me: \"But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man; whereas I was born an angel\'s seed by a daughter of man, so that no word of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born can be overweening. Wherefore also my star is bright in heaven, and men call it, some the Wain, and some the dragon\'s child. I keep near unto this star. So ask me not many things; for thy kingdom also after a little time is to be disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season. And short will be thy tyranny over us; and then we shall again have free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us as if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the angels set over us.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',22,'22','And I Solomon, on hearing this, bound him more carefully, and ordered him to be flogged with thongs of ox-hide, and to tell me humbly what was his name and what his business. And he answered me thus: \"I am called Asmodeus among mortals, and my business is to plot against the newly wedded, so that they may not know one another. And I sever them utterly by many calamities, and I waste away the beauty of virgin women, and estrange their hearts.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',23,'23','And I said to him: \"Is this thy only business?\" And he answered me: \"I transport men into fits of madness and desire, when they have wives of their own, so that they leave them, and go off by night and day to others that belong to other men; with the result that they commit sin, and fall into murderous deeds.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',24,'24','And I adjured him by the name of the Lord Sabaôth, saying: \"Fear God, Asmodeus, and tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" But he said: \"By Raphael, the archangel that stands before the throne of God. But the liver and gall of a fish put me to flight, when smoked over ashes of the tamarisk.\" I again asked him, and said: \"Hide not aught from me. For I am Solomon, son of David, King of Israel. Tell me the name of the fish which thou reverest.\" And he answered: \"It is the Glanos by name, and is found in the rivers of Assyria; wherefore it is that I roam about in those parts.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',25,'25','And I said to him: \"Hast thou nothing else about thee, Asmodeus?\" And he answered: \"The power of God knoweth, which hath bound me with the indissoluble bonds of yonder one\'s seal, that whatever I have told thee is true. I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water.\" But I smiled, and said to him: \"As the Lord God of my fathers liveth, I will lay iron on thee to wear. But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire construction of the Temple, treading it down with thy feet.\" And I ordered them to give him ten water-jars to carry water in. And the demon groaned terribly, and did the work I ordered him to do. And this I did, because that fierce demon Asmodeus knew even the future. And I Solomon glorified God, who gave wisdom to me Solomon his servant. And the liver of the fish and its gall I hung on the spike of a reed, and burned it over Asmodeus because of his being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated.\n'),(42,1,'1',26,'26','And I summoned again to stand before me Beelzeboul, the prince of demons, and I sat him down on a raised seat of honour, and said to him: \"Why art thou alone, prince of the demons?\" And he said to me: \"Because I alone am left of the angels of heaven that came down. For I was first angel in the first heaven being entitled Beelzeboul. And now I control all those who are bound in Tartarus. But I too have a child, and he haunts the Red Sea. And on any suitable occasion he comes up to me again, being subject to me; and reveals to me what he has done, and I support him.\n'),(42,1,'1',27,'27','I Solomon said unto him: \"Beelzeboul, what is thy employment?\" And he answered me: \"I destroy kings. I ally myself with foreign tyrants. And my own demons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and be lost. And the chosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, I excite unto desires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they obey me, and I bear them on to destruction. And I inspire men with envy, and [desire for] murder, and for wars and sodomy, and other evil things. And I will destroy the world.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',28,'28','So I said to him: \"Bring to me thy child, who is, as thou sayest, in the Red Sea.\" But he said to me: \"I will not bring him to thee. But there shall come to me another demon called Ephippas. Him will I bind, and he will bring him up from the deep unto me.\" And I said to him: \"How comes thy son to be in the depth of the sea, and what is his name? \"And he answered me: \"Ask me not, for thou canst not learn from me. However, he will come to thee by any command, and will tell thee openly.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',29,'29','I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"By the holy and precious name of the Almighty God, called by the Hebrews by a row of numbers, of which the sum is 644, and among the Greeks it is Emmanuel. And if one of the Romans adjure me by the great name of the power Eleéth, I disappear at once.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',30,'30','I Solomon was astounded when I heard this; and I ordered him to saw up Theban marbles. And when he began to saw the marbles, the other demons cried out with a loud voice, howling because of their king Beelzeboul.\n'),(42,1,'1',31,'31','But I Solomon questioned him, saying: \"If thou wouldst gain a respite, discourse to me about the things in heaven.\" And Beelzeboul said: \"Hear, O king, if thou burn gum, and incense, and bulb of the sea, with nard and saffron, and light seven lamps in an earthquake, thou wilt firmly fix thy house. And if, being pure , thou light them at dawn in the sun alight, then wilt thou see the heavenly dragons, how they wind themselves along and drag the chariot of the sun.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',32,'32','And I Solomon, having heard this, rebuked him, and said: \"Silence for this present, and continue to saw the marbles as I commanded thee.\" And I Solomon praised God, and commanded another demon to present himself to me. And one came before me who carried his face high up in the air, but the rest of the spirit curled away like a snail. And it broke through the few soldiers, and raised also a terrible dust on the ground, and carried it upwards; and then again hurled it back to frighten us, and asked what questions I could ask as a rule. And I stood up, and spat on the ground in that spot, and sealed with the ring of God. And forthwith the dust-wind stopped. Then I asked him, saying: \"Who art thou, O wind?\" Then he once more shook up a dust, and answered me: \"What wouldst thou have, King Solomon?\" I answered him: \"Tell me what thou art called, and I would fain ask thee a question. But so far I give thanks to God who has made me wise to answer their evil plots.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',33,'33','But [the demon] answered me: \"I am the spirit of the ashes (Tephras).\" And I said to him: \"What is thy pursuit?\" And he said: \"I bring darkness on men, and set fire to fields; and I bring homesteads to naught. But most busy am I in summer. However, when I get an opportunity, I creep into corners of the wall, by night and day. For I am offspring of the great one, and nothing less.\" Accordingly I said to him: \"Under what star dost thou lie?\" And he answered: \"In the very tip of the moon\'s horn, when it is found in the south. There is my star. For I have been bidden to restrain the convulsions of the hemitertian fever; and this is why many men pray to the hemitertian fever, using these three names: Bultala, Thallal, Melchal. And I heal them.\" And I said to him: \"I am Solomon; when therefore thou wouldst do harm, by whose aid dost thou do it?\" But he said to me: \"By the angel\'s, by whom also the third day\'s fever is lulled to rest.\" So I questioned him, and said: \"And by what name?\" And he answered: \"That of the archangel Azael.\" And I summoned the archangel Azael, and set a seal on the demon, and commanded him to seize great stones, and toss them up to the workmen on the higher parts of the Temple. And, being compelled, the demon began to do what he was bidden to do.\n'),(42,1,'1',34,'34','And I glorified God afresh who gave me this authority, and ordered another demon to come before me. And there came seven spirits, females, bound and woven together, fair in appearance and comely. And I Solomon, seeing them, questioned them and said: \"Who are ye?\" But they, with one accord, said with one voice: \"We are of the thirty-three elements of the cosmic ruler of the darkness.\" And the first said: \"I am Deception.\" The second said: \"I am Strife.\" The third: \"I am Klothod, which is battle.\" The fourth: \"I am Jealousy.\" The fifth: \"I am Power.\" The sixth: \"I am Error.\" The seventh: \"I am the worst of all, and our stars are in heaven. Seven stars humble in sheen, and all together. And we are called as it were goddesses. We change our place all and together, and together we live, sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympus, sometimes in a great mountain.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',35,'35','So I Solomon questioned them one by one, beginning with the first, and going down to the seventh. The first said: \"I am Deception, I deceive and weave snares here and there. I whet and excite heresies. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Lamechalal.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',36,'36','Likewise also the second said: \"I am Strife, strife of strifes. I bring timbers, stones, hangers, my weapons on the spot. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Baruchiachel.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',37,'37','Likewise also the third said: \"I am called Klothod , which is Battle, and I cause the well-behaved to scatter and fall foul one of the other. And why do I say so much? I have an angel that frustrates me: \"Marmarath.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',38,'38','Likewise also the fourth said: \"I cause men to forget their sobriety and moderation. I part them and split them into parties; for Strife follows me hand in hand. I rend the husband from the sharer of his bed, and children from parents, and brothers from sisters. But why tell so much to my despite? I have an angel that frustrates me, the great Balthial.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',39,'39','Likewise also the fifth said: \"I am Power. By power I raise up tyrants and tear down kings. To all rebels I furnish power. I have an angel that frustrates me, Asteraôth.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',40,'40','Likewise also the sixth said: \"I am Error, O King Solomon. And I will make thee to err, as I have before made thee to err, when I caused thee to slay thy own brother. I will lead you into error, so as to pry into graves; and I teach them that dig, and I lead errant souls away from all piety, and many other evil traits are mine. But I have an angel that frustrates me, Uriel.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',41,'41','Likewise also the seventh said: \"I am the worst, and I make thee worse off than thou wast; because I will impose the bonds of Artemis. But the locust will set me free, for by means thereof is it fated that thou shalt achieve my desire [...]. For if one were wise, he would not turn his steps toward me.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',42,'42','So I Solomon, having heard and wondered, sealed them with my ring; and since they were so considerable, I bade them dig the foundations of the Temple of God. For the length of it was 250 cubits. And I bade them be industrious, and with one murmur of joint protest they began to perform the tasks enjoined.\n'),(42,1,'1',43,'43','But I Solomon glorified the Lord, and bade another demon come before me. And there was brought to me a demon having all the limbs of a man, but without a head. And I, seeing him, said to him: \"Tell me, who art thou?\'\' And he answered: \"I am a demon.\" So I said to him: \"Which?\" And he answered me: \"I am called Envy. For I delight to devour heads, being desirous to secure for myself a head; but I do not eat enough, but am anxious to have such a head as thou hast.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',44,'44','I Solomon, on hearing this, sealed him, stretching out my hand against his chest. Whereon the demon leapt up, and threw himself down, and gave a groan, saying: \"Woe is me! where am I come to? O traitor Ornias, I cannot see!\" So I said to him: \"I am Solomon. Tell me then how thou dost manage to see.\" And he answered me: \"By means of my feelings.\" I then, Solomon, having heard his voice come up to me, asked him how he managed to speak. And he answered me: \"I, O King Solomon, am wholly voice, for I have inherited the voices of many men. For in the case of all men who are called dumb, I it is who smashed their heads, when they were children and had reached their eighth day. Then when a child is crying in the night, I become a spirit, and glide by means of his voice [...]. In the crossways also I have many services to render, and my encounter is fraught with harm. For I grasp in all instant a man\'s head, and with my hands, as with a sword, I cut it off, and put it on to myself. And in this way, by means of the fire which is in me, through my neck it is swallowed up. I it is that sends grave mutilations and incurable on men\'s feet, and inflict sores.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',45,'45','And I Solomon, on hearing this, said to him: \"Tell me how thou dost discharge forth the fire? Out of what sources dost thou emit it?\" And the spirit said to me: \"From the Day-star. For here hath not yet been found that Elburion, to whom men offer prayers and kindle lights. And his name is invoked by the seven demons before me. And he cherishes them.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',46,'46','But I said to him: \"Tell me his name.\" But he answered: \"I cannot tell thee. For if I tell his name, I render myself incurable. But he will come in response to his name.\" And on hearing this, I Solomon said to him: \"Tell me then, by what angel thou art frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the fiery flash of lightning.\" And I bowed myself before the Lord God of Israel, and bade him remain in the keeping of Beelzeboul until Iax should come.\n'),(42,1,'1',47,'47','Then I ordered another demon to come before me, and there came into my presence a hound, having a very large shape, and it spoke with a loud voice, and said, \"Hail, Lord, King Solomon!\" And I Solomon was astounded. I said to it: Who art thou, O hound?\" And it answered: \"I do indeed seem to thee to be a hound, but before thou wast, O King Solomon, I was a man that wrought many unholy deeds on earth. I was surpassingly learned in letters, and was so mighty that I could hold the stars of heaven back. And many divine works did I prepare. For I do harm to men who follow after our star, and turn them to [...]. And I seize the frenzied men by the larynx, and so destroy them.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',48,'48','And I Solomon said to him: \"What is thy name?\" And he answered: \'\'Staff\" (Rabdos). And I said to him: \"What is thine employment? And what results canst thou achieve?\" And he replied: \'\'Give me thy man, and I will lead him away into a mountainous spot, and will show him a green stone tossed to and fro, with which thou mayest adorn the temple of the Lord God.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',49,'49','And I Solomon, on hearing this, ordered my servant to set off with him, and to take the finger-ring bearing the seal of God with him. And I said to him: \"Whoever shall show thee the green stone, seal him with this finger-ring. And mark the spot with care, and bring me the demon hither. And the demon showed him the green stone, and he sealed it, and brought the demon to me. And I Solomon decided to confine with my seal on my right hand the two, the headless demon, likewise the hound, that was so huge; he should be bound as well. And I bade the hound keep safe the fiery spirit so that lamps as it were might by day and night cast their light through its maw on the artisans at work.\n'),(42,1,'1',50,'50','And I Solomon took from the mine of that stone 200 shekels for the supports of the table of incense, which was similar in appearance. And I Solomon glorified the Lord God, and then closed round the treasure of that stone. And I ordered afresh the demons to cut marble for the construction of the house of God. And I Solomon prayed to the Lord, and asked the hound, saying: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And the demon replied: \"By the great Brieus.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',51,'51','And I praised the Lord God of heaven and earth, and bade another demon come forward to me; and there came before me one in the form of a lion roaring. And he stood and answered me saying: \"O king, in the form which I have, I am a spirit quite incapable of being perceived. Upon all men who lie prostrate with sickness I leap, coming stealthily along; and I render the man weak, so that his habit of body is enfeebled. But I have also another glory, O king. I cast out demons, and I have legions under my control. And I am capable of being received in my dwelling-places, along with all the demons belonging to the legions under me.\" But I Solomon, on hearing this, asked him: \"What is thy name?\" But he answered: \"Lionbearer, Rath in kind.\" And I said to him: \"How art thou to be frustrated along with thy legions? What angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And he answered: \"If I tell thee my name, I bind not myself alone, but also the legions of demons under me.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',52,'52','So I said to him: \"I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell me by what name thou art frustrated along with thy host.\" And the spirit answered me: \"The \'great among men,\' who is to suffer many things at the hands of men, whose name is the figure 644, which is Emmanuel; he it is who has bound us, and who will then come and plunge us from the steep under water. He is noised abroad in the three letters which bring him down.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',53,'53','And I Solomon, on hearing this, glorified God, and condemned his legion to carry wood from the thicket. And I condemned the lion-shaped one himself to saw up the wood small with his teeth, for burning in the unquenchable furnace for the Temple of God.\n'),(42,1,'1',54,'54','And I worshipped the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon come forward. And there came before me a dragon, three-headed, of fearful hue. And I questioned him: \"Who art thou?\" And he answered me: \"I am a caltrop-like spirit, whose activity in three lines. But I blind children in women\'s wombs, and twirl their ears round. And I make them deaf and mute. And I have again in my third head means of slipping in. And I smite men in the limbless part of the body, and cause them to fall down, and foam, and grind their teeth. But I have my own way of being frustrated, Jerusalem being signified in writing, unto the place called \'of the head.\" For there is fore-appointed the angel of the great counsel, and now he will openly dwell on the cross. He doth frustrate me, and to him am I subject.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',55,'55','\"But in the place where thou sittest, O King Solomon, standeth a column in the air, of purple...

But at the entrance of the Temple, which thou hast begun to build, O King Solomon, lies stored much gold, which dig thou up and carry off.\" And I Solomon sent my servant, and found it to be as the demon told me. And I sealed him with my ring, and praised the Lord God.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',56,'56','So I said to him: \"What art thou called?\" And the demon said: \"I am the crest of dragons.\" And I bade him make bricks in the Temple. He had human hands.\n'),(42,1,'1',57,'57','And I adored the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon present himself. And there came before me a spirit in woman\'s form, that had a head without any limbs, and her hair was dishevelled. And I said to her: \"Who art thou?\" But she answered: \"Nay, who art thou? And why dost thou want to hear concerning me? But, as thou wouldst learn, here I stand bound before thy face. Go then into thy royal storehouses and wash thy hands. Then sit down afresh before thy tribunal, and ask me questions; and thou shalt learn, O king, who I am.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',58,'58','And I Solomon did as she enjoined me, and restrained myself because of the wisdom dwelling in me; in order that I might hear of her deeds, and reprehend them, and manifest them to men. And I sat down, and said to the demon: \"What art thou?\" And she said: \"I am called among men Obizuth; and by night I sleep not, but go my rounds over all the world, and visit women in childbirth. And divining the hour I take my stand; and if I am lucky, I strangle the child. But if not, I retire to another place. For I cannot for a single night retire unsuccessful. For I am a fierce spirit, of myriad names and many shapes. And now hither, now thither I roam. And to westering parts I go my rounds. But as it now is, though thou hast sealed me round with the ring of God, thou hast done nothing. I am not standing before thee, and thou wilt not be able to command me. For I have no work other than the destruction of children, and the making their ears to be deaf, and the working of evil to their eyes, and the binding their mouths with a bond, and the ruin of their minds, and paining of their bodies.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',59,'59','When I Solomon heard this, I marvelled at her appearance, for I beheld all her body to be in darkness. But her glance was altogether bright and greeny, and her hair was tossed wildly like a dragon\'s; and the whole of her limbs were invisible. And her voice was very clear as it came to me. And I cunningly said: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated, O evil spirit?\" By she answered me: \"By the angel of God called Afarôt, which is interpreted Raphael, by whom I am frustrated now and for all time. His name, if any man know it, and write the same on a woman in childbirth, then I shall not be able to enter her. Of this name the number is 640.\" And I Solomon having heard this, and having glorified the Lord, ordered her hair to be bound, and that she should be hung up in front of the Temple of God; that all the children of Israel, as they passed, might see it, and glorify the Lord God of Israel, who had given me this authority, with wisdom and power from God, by means of this signet.\n'),(42,1,'1',60,'60','And I again ordered another demon to come before me. And the came, rolling itself along, one in appearance like to a dragon, but having the face and hands of a man. And all its limbs, except the feet, were those of a dragon; and it had wings on its back. And when I beheld it, I was astonied, and said: \"Who art thou, demon, and what art thou called? And whence hast thou come? Tell me.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',61,'61','And the spirit answered and said: \"This is the first time I have stood before the, O King Solomon. I am a spirit made into a god among men, but now brought to naught by the ring and wisdom vouchsafed to thee by God. Now I am the so-called winged dragon, and I chamber not with many women, but only with a few that are of fair shape, which possess the name of xuli, of this star. And I pair with them in the guise of a spirit winged in form, coitum habens per nates. And she on whom I have leapt goes heavy with child, and that which is born of her becomes eros. But since such offspring cannot be carried by men, the woman in question breaks wind. Such is my role. Supposed then only that I am satisfied, and all the other demons molested and disturbed by thee will speak the whole truth. But those composed of fire will cause to be burned up by fire the material of the logs which is to be collected by them for the building in the Temple.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',62,'62','And as the demon said this, I saw the spirit going forth from his mouth, and it consumed the wood of the frankincense-tree, and burned up all the logs which we had placed in the Temple of God. And I Solomon saw what the spirit had done, and I marvelled.\n'),(42,1,'1',63,'63','And, having glorified God, I asked the dragon-shaped demon, and said: \"Tell me, by what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the great angel which has its seat in the second heaven, which is called in Hebrew Bazazeth. And I Solomon, having heard this, and having invoked his angel, condemned him to saw up marbles for the building of the Temple of God; and I praised God, and commanded another demon to come before me.\n'),(42,1,'1',64,'64','And there came before my face another spirit, as it were a woman in the form she had. But on her shoulders she had two other heads with hands. And I asked her, and said: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And she said to me: \"I am Enêpsigos, who also have a myriad names.\" And I said her: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" But she said to me: \"What seekest, what askest thou? I undergo changes, like the goddess I am called. And I change again, and pass into possession of another shape. And be not desirous therefore to know all that concerns me. But since thou art before me for this much, hearken. I have my abode in the moon, and for that reason I possess three forms. At times I am magically invoked by the wise as Kronos. At other times, in connexion with those who bring me down, I come down and appear in another shape. The measure of the element is inexplicable and indefinable, and not to be frustrated. I then, changing into these three forms, come down and become such as thou seest me; but I am frustrated by the angel Rathanael, who sits in the third heaven. This then is why I speak to thee. Yonder temple cannot contain me.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',65,'65','I therefore Solomon prayed to my God, and I invoked the angel of whom Enépsigos spoke to me, and used my seal. And I sealed her with a triple chain, and (placed) beneath her the fastening of the chain. I used the seal of God, and the spirit prophesied to me, saying: \"This is what thou, King Solomon, doest to us. But after a time thy kingdom shall be broken, and again in season this Temple shall be riven asunder; and all Jerusalem shall be undone by the King of the Persians and Medes and Chaldaeans. And the vessels of this Temple, which thou makest, shall be put to servile uses of the gods; and along with them all the jars, in which thou dost shut us up, shall be broken by the hands of men. And then we shall go forth in great power hither and thither, and be disseminated all over the world. And we shall lead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of God is stretched upon the cross. For never before doth arise a king like unto him, one frustrating us all, whose mother shall not have contact with man. Who else can receive such authority over spirits, except he, whom the first devil will seek to tempt, but will not prevail over? The number of his name is 644, which is Emmanuel. Wherefore, O King Solomon, thy time is evil, and thy years short and evil, and to thy servant shall thy kingdom be given.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',66,'66','And I Solomon, having heard this, glorified God. And though I marvelled at the apology of the demons, I did not credit it until it came true. And I did not believe their words; but when they were realized, then I understood, and at my death I wrote this Testament to the children of Israel, and gave it to them, so that they might know the powers of the demons and their shapes, and the names of their angels, by which these angels are frustrated. And I glorified the Lord God of Israel, and commanded the spirits to be bound with bonds indissoluble.\n'),(42,1,'1',67,'67','And having praised God, I commanded another spirit to come before me; and there came before my face another demon, having in front the shape of a horse, but behind of a fish. And he had a mighty voice, and said to me: \"O King Solomon, I am a fierce spirit of the sea, and I am greedy of gold and silver. I am such a spirit as rounds itself and comes over the expanses of the water of the sea, and I trip up the men who sail thereon. For I round myself into a wave, and transform myself, and then throw myself on ships and come right in on them. And that is my business, and my way of getting hold of money and men. For I take the men, and whirl them round with myself, and hurl the men out of the sea. For I am not covetous of men\'s bodies, but cast them up out of the sea so far. But since Beelzeboul, ruler of the spirits of air and of those under the earth, and lord of earthly ones, hath a joint kingship with us in respect of the deeds of each one of us, therefore I went up from the sea, to get a certain outlook in his company.\n'),(42,1,'1',68,'68','\"But I also have another character and role. I metamorphose myself into waves, and come up from the sea. And I show myself to men, so that those on earth call me Kuno[s]paston, because I assume the human form. And my name is a true one. For by my passage up into men, I send forth a certain nausea. I came then to take counsel with the prince Beelzeboul; and he bound me and delivered me into thy hands. And I am here before thee because of this seal, and thou dost now torment me. Behold now, in two or three days the spirit that converseth with thee will fail, because I shall have no water.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',69,'69','And I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"By Iameth.\" And I glorified God. I commanded the spirit to be thrown into a phial along with ten jugs of sea-water of two measures each. And I sealed them round above the marbles and asphalt and pitch in the mouth of the vessel. And having sealed it with my ring, I ordered it to be deposited in the Temple of God. And I ordered another spirit to come before me.\n'),(42,1,'1',70,'70','And there came before my face another enslaved spirit, having obscurely the form of a man, with gleaming eyes, and bearing in his hand a blade. And I asked: \"Who art thou? But he answered: \"I am a lascivious spirit, engendered of a giant man who dies in the massacre in the time of the giants.\" I said to him: \"Tell me what thou art employed on upon earth, and where thou hast thy dwelling.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',71,'71','And he said: \"My dwelling is in fruitful places, but my procedure is this. I seat myself beside the men who pass along among the tombs, and in untimely season I assume the form of the dead; and if I catch any one, I at once destroy him with my sword. But if I cannot destroy him, I cause him to be possessed with a demon, and to devour his own flesh, and the hair to fall off his chin.\" But I said to him: \"Do thou then be in fear of the God of heaven and of earth, and tell me by angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"He destroys me who is to become Saviour, a man whose number, if any one shall write it on his forehead, he will defeat me, and in fear I shall quickly retreat. And, indeed, if any one write this sign on him, I shall be in fear.\" And I Solomon, on hearing this, and having glorified the Lord God, shut up this demon like the rest.\n'),(42,1,'1',72,'72','And I commanded another demon to come before me. And there came before my face thirty-six spirits, their heads shapeless like dogs, but in themselves they were human in form; with faces of asses, faces of oxen, and faces of birds. And I Solomon, on hearing and seeing them, wondered, and I asked them and said: \"Who are you?\" But they, of one accord with one voice, said: \"We are the thirty-six elements, the world-rulers of this darkness. But, O King Solomon, thou wilt not wrong us nor imprison us, nor lay command on us; but since the Lord God has given thee authority over every spirit, in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, therefore do we also present ourselves before thee like the other spirits, from ram and bull, from both twin and crab, lion and virgin, scales and scorpion, archer, goat-horned, waterpourer, and fish.\n'),(42,1,'1',73,'73','Then I Solomon invoked the name of the Lord Sabaoth, and questioned each in turn as to what was its character. And I bade each one come forward and tell of its actions. Then the first one came forward, and said: \"I am the first decans of the zodiacal circle, and I am called the ram, and with me are these two.\" So I put to them the question: \"Who are ye called?\" The first said: \"I, O Lord, am called Ruax, and I cause the heads of men to be idle, and I pillage their brows.

For I have not dared to commit such impiety, poor wretch that I am.\" But I Solomon on hearing this from the youth, exhorted the old man to reflect on the matter, and accept his son\'s apology. However, he would not, but said he would rather let him die. And as the old man would not yield, I was about to pronounce sentence on the youth, when I saw Ornias the demon laughing. I was very angry at the demon\'s laughing in my presence; and I ordered my men to remove the other parties, and bring forward Ornias before my tribunal.

And its blast is harsh and terrible, and it slays man and beast. And no spirit can live upon earth against this demon. I pray thee then, forasmuch as the spirit is a wind, contrive something according to the wisdom given in thee by the Lord thy God, and deign to send a man able to capture it. And behold, King Solomon, I and my people and all my land will serve thee unto death. And all Arabia shall be at peace with thee, if thou wilt perform this act of righteousness for us. Wherefore we pray thee, contemn not our humble prayer, and suffer not to be utterly brought to naught the eparchy subordinated to thy authority.

And when the flask is blown out, thou wilt understand that the demon is (in it). Then hastily tie up the mouth of to flask, and seal it securely with the seal-ring, and lay it carefully on the camel and bring it me hither.

And the demon blew through the middle of the finger-ring into the mouth of the flask, and going in blew out the flask. But the man promptly stood up to it and drew tight with his hand the mouth of the flask, in the name of the Lord God of Sabaôth. And the demon remained within the flask.

And when I entered the Temple, the flask stood up and walked around some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and did homage to me. And I marvelled that even along with the bottle the demon still had power and could walk about; and I commanded it to stand up. And the flask stood up, and stood on its feet all blown out. And I questioned him, saying: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And the spirit within said: \"I am the demon called Ephippas, that is in Arabia.\" And I said to him: \"Is this thy name?\" And he answered: \"Yes; wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire and do to death.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',122,'122','And I said to him: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the only-ruling God, that hath authority over me even to be heard.

I wither trees and make their leaves to fall off.\" And I said to him: \"Canst thou raise this stone, and lay it for the beginning of this corner which exists in the fair plan of the Temple?\'\' And he said: \"Not only raise this, O king; but also, with the help of the demon who presides over the Red Sea, I will bring up the pillar of air, and will stand it where thou wilt in Jerusalem.\'\'\n'),(42,1,'1',123,'123','Saying this, I laid stress on him, and the flask became as if depleted of air.

And I Solomon, beholding the stone raised aloft and placed on a foundation, said: \"Truly the Scripture is fulfilled, which says: \'The stone which the builders rejected on trial, that same is become the head of the corner.\' For this it is not mine to grant, but God\'s, that the demon should be strong enough to lift up so great a stone and deposit it in the place I wished.\"\n'),(42,1,'1',124,'124','And Ephippas led the demon of the Red Sea with the column.

And there the pillar was hanging of enormous size, in mid air, supported by the winds. And thus the spirits appeared underneath, like air, supporting it.
