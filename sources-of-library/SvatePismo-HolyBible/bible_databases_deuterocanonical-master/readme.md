The *lost books* have not been as zealously preserved as the mainstream canonical scriptures (The Bible) we know today. Many of these are translations of translations, copies of copies. Some of the books may have additions or subtractions that occurred in history as they were imperfectly copied and transmitted.
 
Some of these books are the product of digital copying and may have small errors in them (such as the use of *0 zero* where *O letter O* should be). If you detect these, feel free to submit changes. 

Please note that in the process of copying, I've removed all commentaries. The intent is to preserve scripture rather than human additions such as commentaries, subheadings, and credits.

In the future I may provide seperate meta files regarding details on particular books (translators, dates, etc) but for now I'm focused on building the library.

These books are believed to be in the public domain. If you find otherwise, please notify me via GitHub.

## MySQL Database

All books are listed in the `book_key` table:

```
+-----------+-----------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field     | Type            | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-----------+-----------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id        | int(3) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| weight    | float           | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| name      | varchar(255)    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| info_text | text            | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| info_url  | text            | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| path      | varchar(255)    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+-----------+-----------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

---

**id:** Book ID

**weight:** Book listing priority. Lower numbers = higher priority.

**name:** Name of book.

**info_text:** Information on the book.

**info_url:** Wikipedia url regarding book.

**path:** The slug path within the md or txt directory, excluding the .txt or .md extension.

---


All books are contained in the `books` table, where `b` is the `id` field of `book_key`.

```
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| b     | int(11)     | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| c     | int(11)     | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| cs    | varchar(10) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| v     | int(11)     | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| vs    | varchar(10) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| t     | text        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

---

**b:** Book ID that links to book_key.id

**c:** Chapter of the book.

**cs:** Chapter String *(such as 1a or 1b type verses, where translators listed multiple variants of a verse or chapter)*

**v:** The verse.

**vs:** Verse String *(such as 1a or 1b type verses, where translators listed multiple variants of a verse or chapter)*

**t:** Text, or actual content of the verse.

Explore the database to see how it works. 

### Example 1  

Get the first chapter 1 Enoch:

```
select * from books where b = 1 and c = 1;
```

... where book 1 is the `book_key` `id` for 1 Enoch, and `c` is the chapter (chapter 1). 

### Example 2

```
select t from books where b = 42 and c = 1 and v = 1;
```

... where `t` is text, b is the `book_key` `id` for The Testement of Solomon, and `c` is the chapter and `v` is the verse.

### Example 3

```
Select * from book_key;
```

...will give you a list of the books with their IDs.

### MySQL Database Structure Notes...

Like the scrollmapper bible databases, I have endeavored to keep the database structure simple for those who are not experienced with SQL.
